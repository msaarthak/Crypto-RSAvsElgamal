# Crypto-RSAvsElgamal
Elgamal and RSA algorithms are widely used for data authentication and confidentiality. In this project we compared the performance of both algorithms and concluded that Elgamal is more efficient than RSA. 

This project was done with the help of Code from this repository: - https://github.com/yash755/RSA-and-Elgamal-Comparison

Also, the work done here was under the supervision of Dr. Hosam El-Ocla. His work can be found here: - http://flash.lakeheadu.ca/~hosam/

This project was perforemed using Python and one of the pre-requisites is to import the pycrypto library.
