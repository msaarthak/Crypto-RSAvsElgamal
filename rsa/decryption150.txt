b'India, officially the Republic of India (Bh\xc4\x81rat Ga\xe1\xb9\x87ar\xc4\x81jya),['b'e] is a country in South Asia. It is the seventh-largest cou'b'ntry by area, the second-most populous country (with over 1.'b'2 billion people), and the most populous democracy in the wo'b'rld. It is bounded by the Indian Ocean on the south, the Ara'b'bian Sea on the southwest, and the Bay of Bengal on the sout'b'heast. It shares land borders with Pakistan to the west;[f] 'b'China, Nepal, and Bhutan to the northeast; and Myanmar (Burm'b'a) and Bangladesh to the east. In the Indian Ocean, India is'b" in the vicinity of Sri Lanka and the Maldives. India's Anda"b'man and Nicobar Islands share a maritime border with Thailan'b'd and Indonesia.\n\nThe Indian subcontinent was home to the ur'b'ban Indus Valley Civilisation of the 3rd millennium BCE. In 'b'the following millennium, the oldest scriptures associated w'b'ith Hinduism began to be composed. Social stratification, ba'b'sed on caste, emerged in the first millennium BCE, and Buddh'b'ism and Jainism arose. Early political consolidations took p'b'lace under the Maurya and Gupta empires; the later peninsula'b'r Middle Kingdoms influenced cultures as far as southeast As'b'ia. In the medieval era, Judaism, Zoroastrianism, Christiani'b'ty, and Islam arrived, and Sikhism emerged, all adding to th'b"e region's diverse culture. Much of the north fell to the De"b'lhi sultanate; the south was united under the Vijayanagara E'b'mpire. The economy expanded in the 17th century in the Mugha'b'l Empire. In the mid-18th century, the subcontinent came und'b'er British East India Company rule, and in the mid-19th unde'b'r British crown rule. A nationalist movement emerged in the 'b'late 19th century, which later, under Mahatma Gandhi, was no'b"ted for nonviolent resistance and led to India's independenc"b"e in 1947.\n\nIn 2015, the Indian economy was the world's seve"b'nth largest by nominal GDP and third largest by purchasing p'b'ower parity.[15] Following market-based economic reforms in 'b'1991, India became one of the fastest-growing major economie'b's and is considered a newly industrialised country. However,'b' it continues to face the challenges of poverty, corruption,'b' malnutrition, and inadequate public healthcare. A nuclear w'b'eapons state and regional power, it has the third largest st'b'anding army in the world and ranks fifth in military expendi'b'ture among nations. India is a federal republic governed und'b'er a parliamentary system and consists of 29 states and 7 un'b'ion territories. It is a pluralistic, multilingual and multi'b'-ethnic society and is also home to a diversity of wildlife 'b'in a variety of protected habitats.\nEtymology\nMain article: 'b'Names of India\nThe name India is derived from Indus, which o'b'riginates from the Old Persian word Hindu.[18] The latter te'b'rm stems from the Sanskrit word Sindhu, which was the histor'b'ical local appellation for the Indus River.[19] The ancient 'b'Greeks referred to the Indians as Indoi (\xe1\xbc\xb8\xce\xbd\xce\xb4\xce\xbf\xce\xaf), which trans'b'lates as "The people of the Indus".[20]\n\nThe geographical te'b'rm Bharat (Bh\xc4\x81rat, pronounced [\xcb\x88b\xca\xb1a\xcb\x90r\xc9\x99t\xcc\xaa] ( listen)), which 'b'is recognised by the Constitution of India as an official na'b'me for the country,[21] is used by many Indian languages in 'b'its variations. It is a modernisation of the historical name'b' Bharatavarsha, which traditionally referred to the Indian s'b'ubcontinent and gained increasing currency from the mid-19th'b' century as a native name for India.[22][23] Scholars believ'b'e it to be named after the Vedic tribe of Bh\xc4\x81ratas in the se'b'cond millennium BCE.[24] It is also traditionally associated'b' with the rule of the legendary emperor Bharata.[25] Ga\xe1\xb9\x87ar\xc4\x81j'b"ya (literally, people's State) is the Sanskrit/Hindi term fo"b'r "republic" dating back to the ancient times.[26][27][28]\n\n'b'Hindustan ([\xc9\xa6\xc9\xaand\xcc\xaa\xca\x8a\xcb\x88st\xcc\xaaa\xcb\x90n] ( listen)) is a Persian name for 'b'India dating back to the 3rd century BCE. It was introduced 'b'into India by the Mughals and widely used since then. Its me'b'aning varied, referring to a region that encompassed norther'b'n India and Pakistan or India in its entirety.[22][23][29] C'b'urrently, the name may refer to either the northern part of 'b'India or the entire country.[29]\n\nHistory\nMain articles: His'b'tory of India and History of the Republic of India\nAncient I'b'ndia\nThe earliest authenticated human remains in South Asia 'b'date to about 30,000 years ago.[30] Nearly contemporaneous M'b'esolithic rock art sites have been found in many parts of th'b'e Indian subcontinent, including at the Bhimbetka rock shelt'b'ers in Madhya Pradesh.[31] Around 7000 BCE, the first known 'b'Neolithic settlements appeared on the subcontinent in Mehrga'b'rh and other sites in western Pakistan.[32] These gradually 'b'developed into the Indus Valley Civilisation,[33] the first 'b'urban culture in South Asia;[34] it flourished during 2500\xe2\x80\x931'b'900 BCE in Pakistan and western India.[35] Centred around ci'b'ties such as Mohenjo-daro, Harappa, Dholavira, and Kalibanga'b'n, and relying on varied forms of subsistence, the civilisat'b'ion engaged robustly in crafts production and wide-ranging t'b'rade.[34]\n\nDuring the period 2000\xe2\x80\x93500 BCE, in terms of cultu'b're, many regions of the subcontinent transitioned from the C'b'halcolithic to the Iron Age.[36] The Vedas, the oldest scrip'b'tures associated with Hinduism,[37] were composed during thi'b's period,[38] and historians have analysed these to posit a 'b'Vedic culture in the Punjab region and the upper Gangetic Pl'b'ain.[36] Most historians also consider this period to have e'b'ncompassed several waves of Indo-Aryan migration into the su'b'bcontinent.[39][37] The caste system arose during this perio'b'd, creating a hierarchy of priests, warriors, free peasants 'b'and traders, and lastly the indigenous peoples who were rega'b'rded as impure; and small tribal units gradually coalesced i'b'nto monarchical, state-level polities.[40][41] On the Deccan'b' Plateau, archaeological evidence from this period suggests 'b'the existence of a chiefdom stage of political organisation.'b'[36] In southern India, a progression to sedentary life is i'b'ndicated by the large number of megalithic monuments dating 'b'from this period,[42] as well as by nearby traces of agricul'b'ture, irrigation tanks, and craft traditions.[42]\n\nDamaged b'b'rown painting of a reclining man and woman.\nPaintings at the'b' Ajanta Caves in Aurangabad, Maharashtra, 6th century\nIn the'b' late Vedic period, around the 6th century BCE, the small st'b'ates and chiefdoms of the Ganges Plain and the north-western'b' regions had consolidated into 16 major oligarchies and mona'b'rchies that were known as the mahajanapadas.[43][44] The eme'b'rging urbanisation gave rise to non-Vedic religious movement'b's, two of which became independent religions. Jainism came i'b'nto prominence during the life of its exemplar, Mahavira.[45'b'] Buddhism, based on the teachings of Gautama Buddha attract'b'ed followers from all social classes excepting the middle cl'b'ass; chronicling the life of the Buddha was central to the b'b'eginnings of recorded history in India.[46][47][48] In an ag'b'e of increasing urban wealth, both religions held up renunci'b'ation as an ideal,[49] and both established long-lasting mon'b'astic traditions. Politically, by the 3rd century BCE, the k'b'ingdom of Magadha had annexed or reduced other states to eme'b'rge as the Mauryan Empire.[50] The empire was once thought t'b'o have controlled most of the subcontinent excepting the far'b' south, but its core regions are now thought to have been se'b'parated by large autonomous areas.[51][52] The Mauryan kings'b' are known as much for their empire-building and determined 'b"management of public life as for Ashoka's renunciation of mi"b'litarism and far-flung advocacy of the Buddhist dhamma.[53]['b'54]\n\nThe Sangam literature of the Tamil language reveals tha'b't, between 200 BCE and 200 CE, the southern peninsula was be'b'ing ruled by the Cheras, the Cholas, and the Pandyas, dynast'b'ies that traded extensively with the Roman Empire and with W'b'est and South-East Asia.[55][56] In North India, Hinduism as'b'serted patriarchal control within the family, leading to inc'b'reased subordination of women.[57][50] By the 4th and 5th ce'b'nturies, the Gupta Empire had created in the greater Ganges 'b'Plain a complex system of administration and taxation that b'b'ecame a model for later Indian kingdoms.[58][59] Under the G'b'uptas, a renewed Hinduism based on devotion rather than the 'b'management of ritual began to assert itself.[60] The renewal'b' was reflected in a flowering of sculpture and architecture,'b' which found patrons among an urban elite.[59] Classical San'b'skrit literature flowered as well, and Indian science, astro'b'nomy, medicine, and mathematics made significant advances.[5'b'9]\n\nMedieval India\n\nThe granite tower of Brihadeeswarar Temp'b'le in Thanjavur was completed in 1010 CE by Raja Raja Chola 'b'I.\nThe Indian early medieval age, 600 CE to 1200 CE, is defi'b'ned by regional kingdoms and cultural diversity.[61] When Ha'b'rsha of Kannauj, who ruled much of the Indo-Gangetic Plain f'b'rom 606 to 647 CE, attempted to expand southwards, he was de'b'feated by the Chalukya ruler of the Deccan.[62] When his suc'b'cessor attempted to expand eastwards, he was defeated by the'b' Pala king of Bengal.[62] When the Chalukyas attempted to ex'b'pand southwards, they were defeated by the Pallavas from far'b'ther south, who in turn were opposed by the Pandyas and the 'b'Cholas from still farther south.[62] No ruler of this period'b' was able to create an empire and consistently control lands'b' much beyond his core region.[61] During this time, pastoral'b' peoples whose land had been cleared to make way for the gro'b'wing agricultural economy were accommodated within caste soc'b'iety, as were new non-traditional ruling classes.[63] The ca'b'ste system consequently began to show regional differences.['b'63]\n\nIn the 6th and 7th centuries, the first devotional hymn'b's were created in the Tamil language.[64] They were imitated'b' all over India and led to both the resurgence of Hinduism a'b'nd the development of all modern languages of the subcontine'b'nt.[64] Indian royalty, big and small, and the temples they 'b'patronised, drew citizens in great numbers to the capital ci'b'ties, which became economic hubs as well.[65] Temple towns o'b'f various sizes began to appear everywhere as India underwen'b't another urbanisation.[65] By the 8th and 9th centuries, th'b'e effects were felt in South-East Asia, as South Indian cult'b'ure and political systems were exported to lands that became'b' part of modern-day Myanmar, Thailand, Laos, Cambodia, Vietn'b'am, Philippines, Malaysia, and Java.[66] Indian merchants, s'b'cholars, and sometimes armies were involved in this transmis'b'sion; South-East Asians took the initiative as well, with ma'b'ny sojourning in Indian seminaries and translating Buddhist 'b'and Hindu texts into their languages.[66]\n\nAfter the 10th ce'b'ntury, Muslim Central Asian nomadic clans, using swift-horse'b' cavalry and raising vast armies united by ethnicity and rel'b"igion, repeatedly overran South Asia's north-western plains,"b' leading eventually to the establishment of the Islamic Delh'b'i Sultanate in 1206.[67] The sultanate was to control much o'b'f North India, and to make many forays into South India. Alt'b'hough at first disruptive for the Indian elites, the sultana'b'te largely left its vast non-Muslim subject population to it'b's own laws and customs.[68][69] By repeatedly repulsing Mong'b'ol raiders in the 13th century, the sultanate saved India fr'b'om the devastation visited on West and Central Asia, setting'b' the scene for centuries of migration of fleeing soldiers, l'b'earned men, mystics, traders, artists, and artisans from tha'b't region into the subcontinent, thereby creating a syncretic'b" Indo-Islamic culture in the north.[70][71] The sultanate's "b'raiding and weakening of the regional kingdoms of South Indi'b'a paved the way for the indigenous Vijayanagara Empire.[72] 'b'Embracing a strong Shaivite tradition and building upon the 'b'military technology of the sultanate, the empire came to con'b'trol much of peninsular India,[73] and was to influence Sout'b'h Indian society for long afterwards.[72]\n\nEarly modern Indi'b'a\n\nWriting the will and testament of the Mughal king court i'b'n Persian, 1590\xe2\x80\x931595\nIn the early 16th century, northern Ind'b'ia, being then under mainly Muslim rulers,[74] fell again to'b' the superior mobility and firepower of a new generation of 'b'Central Asian warriors.[75] The resulting Mughal Empire did 'b'not stamp out the local societies it came to rule, but rathe'b'r balanced and pacified them through new administrative prac'b'tices[76][77] and diverse and inclusive ruling elites,[78] l'b'eading to more systematic, centralised, and uniform rule.[79'b'] Eschewing tribal bonds and Islamic identity, especially un'b'der Akbar, the Mughals united their far-flung realms through'b' loyalty, expressed through a Persianised culture, to an emp'b"eror who had near-divine status.[78] The Mughal state's econ"b'omic policies, deriving most revenues from agriculture[80] a'b'nd mandating that taxes be paid in the well-regulated silver'b' currency,[81] caused peasants and artisans to enter larger 'b'markets.[79] The relative peace maintained by the empire dur'b"ing much of the 17th century was a factor in India's economi"b'c expansion,[79] resulting in greater patronage of painting,'b' literary forms, textiles, and architecture.[82] Newly coher'b'ent social groups in northern and western India, such as the'b' Marathas, the Rajputs, and the Sikhs, gained military and g'b'overning ambitions during Mughal rule, which, through collab'b'oration or adversity, gave them both recognition and militar'b'y experience.[83] Expanding commerce during Mughal rule gave'b' rise to new Indian commercial and political elites along th'b'e coasts of southern and eastern India.[83] As the empire di'b'sintegrated, many among these elites were able to seek and c'b'ontrol their own affairs.[84]\n\nBy the early 18th century, wi'b'th the lines between commercial and political dominance bein'b'g increasingly blurred, a number of European trading compani'b'es, including the English East India Company, had establishe'b"d coastal outposts.[85][86] The East India Company's control"b' of the seas, greater resources, and more advanced military 'b'training and technology led it to increasingly flex its mili'b'tary muscle and caused it to become attractive to a portion 'b'of the Indian elite; these factors were crucial in allowing 'b'the company to gain control over the Bengal region by 1765 a'b'nd sideline the other European companies.[87][85][88][89] It'b's further access to the riches of Bengal and the subsequent 'b'increased strength and size of its army enabled it to annex 'b'or subdue most of India by the 1820s.[90] India was then no 'b'longer exporting manufactured goods as it long had, but was 'b'instead supplying the British Empire with raw materials, and'b" many historians consider this to be the onset of India's co"b'lonial period.[85] By this time, with its economic power sev'b'erely curtailed by the British parliament and itself effecti'b'vely made an arm of British administration, the company bega'b'n to more consciously enter non-economic arenas such as educ'b'ation, social reform, and culture.[91]\n\nModern India\n\nThe Br'b'itish Indian Empire, from the 1909 edition of The Imperial G'b'azetteer of India. Areas directly governed by the British ar'b'e shaded pink; the princely states under British suzerainty 'b"are in yellow.\nHistorians consider India's modern age to hav"b'e begun sometime between 1848 and 1885. The appointment in 1'b'848 of Lord Dalhousie as Governor General of the East India 'b'Company set the stage for changes essential to a modern stat'b'e. These included the consolidation and demarcation of sover'b'eignty, the surveillance of the population, and the educatio'b'n of citizens. Technological changes\xe2\x80\x94among them, railways, c'b'anals, and the telegraph\xe2\x80\x94were introduced not long after thei'b'r introduction in Europe.[92][93][94][95] However, disaffect'b'ion with the company also grew during this time, and set off'b' the Indian Rebellion of 1857. Fed by diverse resentments an'b'd perceptions, including invasive British-style social refor'b'ms, harsh land taxes, and summary treatment of some rich lan'b'downers and princes, the rebellion rocked many regions of no'b'rthern and central India and shook the foundations of Compan'b'y rule.[96][97] Although the rebellion was suppressed by 185'b'8, it led to the dissolution of the East India Company and t'b'o the direct administration of India by the British governme'b'nt. Proclaiming a unitary state and a gradual but limited Br'b'itish-style parliamentary system, the new rulers also protec'b'ted princes and landed gentry as a feudal safeguard against 'b'future unrest.[98][99] In the decades following, public life'b' gradually emerged all over India, leading eventually to the'b' founding of the Indian National Congress in 1885.[100][101]'b'[102][103]\n\nJawaharlal Nehru sharing a joke with Mahatma Gan'b'dhi, Mumbai, 6 July 1946\nJawaharlal Nehru (left) became Indi'b"a's first prime minister in 1947. Mahatma Gandhi (right) led"b' the independence movement.\nThe rush of technology and the c'b'ommercialisation of agriculture in the second half of the 19'b'th century was marked by economic setbacks\xe2\x80\x94many small farmer'b's became dependent on the whims of far-away markets.[104] Th'b'ere was an increase in the number of large-scale famines,[10'b'5] and, despite the risks of infrastructure development born'b'e by Indian taxpayers, little industrial employment was gene'b'rated for Indians.[106] There were also salutary effects: co'b'mmercial cropping, especially in the newly canalled Punjab, 'b'led to increased food production for internal consumption.[1'b'07] The railway network provided critical famine relief,[108'b'] notably reduced the cost of moving goods,[108] and helped 'b'nascent Indian-owned industry.[107]\n\nAfter World War I, in w'b'hich approximately one million Indians served,[109] a new pe'b'riod began. It was marked by British reforms but also repres'b'sive legislations, by more strident Indian calls for self-ru'b'le, and by the beginnings of a nonviolent movement of non-co'b'-operation, of which Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi would become'b' the leader and enduring symbol.[110] During the 1930s, slow'b' legislative reform was enacted by the British; the Indian N'b'ational Congress won victories in the resulting elections.[1'b'11] The next decade was beset with crises: Indian participat'b"ion in World War II, the Congress's final push for non-co-op"b'eration, and an upsurge of Muslim nationalism. All were capp'b'ed by the advent of independence in 1947, but tempered by th'b'e partition of India into two states: India and Pakistan.[11'b"2]\n\nVital to India's self-image as an independent nation was"b' its constitution, completed in 1950, which put in place a s'b'ecular and democratic republic.[113] In the 60 years since, 'b'India has had a mixed record of successes and failures.[114]'b' It has remained a democracy with civil liberties, an active'b' Supreme Court, and a largely independent press.[114] Econom'b'ic liberalisation, which was begun in the 1990s, has created'b' a large urban middle class, transformed India into one of t'b"he world's fastest-growing economies,[115] and increased its"b' geopolitical clout. Indian movies, music, and spiritual tea'b'chings play an increasing role in global culture.[114] Yet, 'b'India is also shaped by seemingly unyielding poverty, both r'b'ural and urban;[114] by religious and caste-related violence'b';[116] by Maoist-inspired Naxalite insurgencies;[117] and by'b' separatism in Jammu and Kashmir and in Northeast India.[118'b'] It has unresolved territorial disputes with China[119] and'b' with Pakistan.[119] The India\xe2\x80\x93Pakistan nuclear rivalry came'b" to a head in 1998.[120] India's sustained democratic freedo"b"ms are unique among the world's newer nations; however, in s"b'pite of its recent economic successes, freedom from want for'b' its disadvantaged population remains a goal yet to be achie'b'ved.[121]\n\nGeography\nMain article: Geography of India\nMap of'b' India. Most of India is yellow (elevation 100\xe2\x80\x931000 m). Some'b' areas in the south and mid-east are brown (above 1000 m). M'b'ajor river valleys are green (below 100 m).\nA topographic ma'b'p of India\nIndia comprises the bulk of the Indian subcontine'b'nt, lying atop the Indian tectonic plate, and part of the In'b"do-Australian Plate.[122] India's defining geological proces"b'ses began 75 million years ago when the Indian plate, then p'b'art of the southern supercontinent Gondwana, began a north-e'b'astward drift caused by seafloor spreading to its south-west'b', and later, south and south-east.[122] Simultaneously, the 'b'vast Tethyn oceanic crust, to its northeast, began to subduc'b't under the Eurasian plate.[122] These dual processes, drive'b"n by convection in the Earth's mantle, both created the Indi"b'an Ocean and caused the Indian continental crust eventually 'b'to under-thrust Eurasia and to uplift the Himalayas.[122] Im'b'mediately south of the emerging Himalayas, plate movement cr'b'eated a vast trough that rapidly filled with river-borne sed'b'iment[123] and now constitutes the Indo-Gangetic Plain.[124]'b' Cut off from the plain by the ancient Aravalli Range lies t'b'he Thar Desert.[125]\n\nThe original Indian plate survives as 'b'peninsular India, the oldest and geologically most stable pa'b'rt of India. It extends as far north as the Satpura and Vind'b'hya ranges in central India. These parallel chains run from 'b'the Arabian Sea coast in Gujarat in the west to the coal-ric'b'h Chota Nagpur Plateau in Jharkhand in the east.[126] To the'b' south, the remaining peninsular landmass, the Deccan Platea'b'u, is flanked on the west and east by coastal ranges known a'b's the Western and Eastern Ghats;[127] the plateau contains t'b"he country's oldest rock formations, some over one billion y"b'ears old. Constituted in such fashion, India lies to the nor'b"th of the equator between 6\xc2\xb0 44' and 35\xc2\xb0 30' north latitude["b"g] and 68\xc2\xb0 7' and 97\xc2\xb0 25' east longitude.[128]\n\nA shining wh"b'ite snow-clad range, framed against a turquoise sky. In the 'b'middle ground, a ridge descends from the right to form a sad'b'dle in the centre of the photograph, partly in shadow. In th'b'e near foreground, a loop of a road is seen.\nThe Kedar Range'b' of the Greater Himalayas rises behind Kedarnath Temple (Ind'b'ian state of Uttarakhand), which is one of the twelve jyotir'b"linga shrines.\nIndia's coastline measures 7,517 kilometres ("b'4,700 mi) in length; of this distance, 5,423 kilometres (3,4'b'00 mi) belong to peninsular India and 2,094 kilometres (1,30'b'0 mi) to the Andaman, Nicobar, and Lakshadweep island chains'b'.[129] According to the Indian naval hydrographic charts, th'b'e mainland coastline consists of the following: 43% sandy be'b'aches; 11% rocky shores, including cliffs; and 46% mudflats 'b'or marshy shores.[129]\n\nMajor Himalayan-origin rivers that s'b'ubstantially flow through India include the Ganges and the B'b'rahmaputra, both of which drain into the Bay of Bengal.[130]'b' Important tributaries of the Ganges include the Yamuna and 'b"the Kosi; the latter's extremely low gradient often leads to"b' severe floods and course changes.[131] Major peninsular riv'b'ers, whose steeper gradients prevent their waters from flood'b'ing, include the Godavari, the Mahanadi, the Kaveri, and the'b' Krishna, which also drain into the Bay of Bengal;[132] and 'b'the Narmada and the Tapti, which drain into the Arabian Sea.'b'[133] Coastal features include the marshy Rann of Kutch of w'b'estern India and the alluvial Sundarbans delta of eastern In'b'dia; the latter is shared with Bangladesh.[134] India has tw'b"o archipelagos: the Lakshadweep, coral atolls off India's so"b'uth-western coast; and the Andaman and Nicobar Islands, a vo'b'lcanic chain in the Andaman Sea.[135]\n\nThe Indian climate is'b' strongly influenced by the Himalayas and the Thar Desert, b'b'oth of which drive the economically and culturally pivotal s'b'ummer and winter monsoons.[136] The Himalayas prevent cold C'b'entral Asian katabatic winds from blowing in, keeping the bu'b'lk of the Indian subcontinent warmer than most locations at 'b'similar latitudes.[137][138] The Thar Desert plays a crucial'b' role in attracting the moisture-laden south-west summer mon'b'soon winds that, between June and October, provide the major'b"ity of India's rainfall.[136] Four major climatic groupings "b'predominate in India: tropical wet, tropical dry, subtropica'b'l humid, and montane.[139]\n\nBiodiversity\nMain article: Wildl'b'ife of India\n\nThe lotus (Nelumbo nucifera) is the Indian nat'b'ional flower. Hindus and Buddhists regard it as a sacred sym'b'bol of enlightenment.[140]\nIndia lies within the Indomalaya 'b'ecozone and contains three biodiversity hotspots.[141] One o'b'f 17 megadiverse countries, it hosts 8.6% of all mammalian, 'b'13.7% of all avian, 7.9% of all reptilian, 6% of all amphibi'b'an, 12.2% of all piscine, and 6.0% of all flowering plant sp'b"ecies.[142][143] About 21.2% of the country's landmass is co"b'vered by forests (tree canopy density >10%), of which 12.2% 'b'comprises moderately or very dense forests (tree canopy dens'b'ity >40%).[144] Endemism is high among plants, 33%, and amon'b'g ecoregions such as the shola forests.[145] Habitat ranges 'b'from the tropical rainforest of the Andaman Islands, Western'b' Ghats, and North-East India to the coniferous forest of the'b' Himalaya. Between these extremes lie the moist deciduous sa'b'l forest of eastern India; the dry deciduous teak forest of 'b'central and southern India; and the babul-dominated thorn fo'b'rest of the central Deccan and western Gangetic plain.[146] 'b'The medicinal neem, widely used in rural Indian herbal remed'b'ies, is a key Indian tree. The luxuriant pipal fig tree, sho'b'wn on the seals of Mohenjo-daro, shaded Gautama Buddha as he'b' sought enlightenment.\n\nMany Indian species descend from tax'b'a originating in Gondwana, from which the Indian plate separ'b'ated more than 105 million years before present.[147] Penins'b"ular India's subsequent movement towards and collision with "b'the Laurasian landmass set off a mass exchange of species. E'b'pochal volcanism and climatic changes 20 million years ago f'b'orced a mass extinction.[148] Mammals then entered India fro'b'm Asia through two zoogeographical passes flanking the risin'b'g Himalaya.[146] Thus, while 45.8% of reptiles and 55.8% of 'b'amphibians are endemic, only 12.6% of mammals and 4.5% of bi'b'rds are.[143] Among them are the Nilgiri leaf monkey and Bed'b"dome's toad of the Western Ghats. India contains 172 IUCN-de"b'signated threatened animal species, or 2.9% of endangered fo'b'rms.[149] These include the Asiatic lion, the Bengal tiger, 'b'the snow leopard and the Indian white-rumped vulture, which,'b' by ingesting the carrion of diclofenac-laced cattle, nearly'b' became extinct.\n\nThe pervasive and ecologically devastating'b' human encroachment of recent decades has critically endange'b'red Indian wildlife. In response the system of national park'b's and protected areas, first established in 1935, was substa'b'ntially expanded. In 1972, India enacted the Wildlife Protec'b'tion Act[150] and Project Tiger to safeguard crucial wildern'b'ess; the Forest Conservation Act was enacted in 1980 and ame'b'ndments added in 1988.[151] India hosts more than five hundr'b'ed wildlife sanctuaries and thirteen biosphere reserves,[152'b'] four of which are part of the World Network of Biosphere R'b'eserves; twenty-five wetlands are registered under the Ramsa'b'r Convention.[153]\n\nPolitics\nMain article: Politics of India'b'\n\nA parliamentary joint session being held in the Sansad Bha'b"van.\nIndia is the world's most populous democracy.[154] A pa"b'rliamentary republic with a multi-party system,[155] it has 'b'seven recognised national parties, including the Indian Nati'b'onal Congress and the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), and more'b' than 40 regional parties.[156] The Congress is considered c'b'entre-left in Indian political culture,[157] and the BJP rig'b'ht-wing.[158][159][160] For most of the period between 1950\xe2\x80\x94'b'when India first became a republic\xe2\x80\x94and the late 1980s, the C'b'ongress held a majority in the parliament. Since then, howev'b'er, it has increasingly shared the political stage with the 'b'BJP,[161] as well as with powerful regional parties which ha'b've often forced the creation of multi-party coalitions at th'b"e centre.[162]\n\nIn the Republic of India's first three gener"b'al elections, in 1951, 1957, and 1962, the Jawaharlal Nehru-'b"led Congress won easy victories. On Nehru's death in 1964, L"b'al Bahadur Shastri briefly became prime minister; he was suc'b'ceeded, after his own unexpected death in 1966, by Indira Ga'b'ndhi, who went on to lead the Congress to election victories'b' in 1967 and 1971. Following public discontent with the stat'b'e of emergency she declared in 1975, the Congress was voted 'b'out of power in 1977; the then-new Janata Party, which had o'b'pposed the emergency, was voted in. Its government lasted ju'b'st over three years. Voted back into power in 1980, the Cong'b'ress saw a change in leadership in 1984, when Indira Gandhi 'b'was assassinated; she was succeeded by her son Rajiv Gandhi,'b' who won an easy victory in the general elections later that'b' year. The Congress was voted out again in 1989 when a Natio'b'nal Front coalition, led by the newly formed Janata Dal in a'b'lliance with the Left Front, won the elections; that governm'b'ent too proved relatively short-lived, lasting just under tw'b'o years.[163] Elections were held again in 1991; no party wo'b'n an absolute majority. The Congress, as the largest single 'b'party, was able to form a minority government led by P. V. N'b'arasimha Rao.[164]\n\n\nThe Rashtrapati Bhavan is the official 'b'residence of the president of India.\nA two-year period of po'b'litical turmoil followed the general election of 1996. Sever'b'al short-lived alliances shared power at the centre. The BJP'b' formed a government briefly in 1996; it was followed by two'b' comparatively long-lasting United Front coalitions, which d'b'epended on external support. In 1998, the BJP was able to fo'b'rm a successful coalition, the National Democratic Alliance 'b'(NDA). Led by Atal Bihari Vajpayee, the NDA became the first'b' non-Congress, coalition government to complete a five-year 'b'term.[165] In the 2004 Indian general elections, again no pa'b'rty won an absolute majority, but the Congress emerged as th'b'e largest single party, forming another successful coalition'b': the United Progressive Alliance (UPA). It had the support 'b'of left-leaning parties and MPs who opposed the BJP. The UPA'b' returned to power in the 2009 general election with increas'b'ed numbers, and it no longer required external support from 'b"India's communist parties.[166] That year, Manmohan Singh be"b'came the first prime minister since Jawaharlal Nehru in 1957'b' and 1962 to be re-elected to a consecutive five-year term.['b'167] In the 2014 general election, the BJP became the first 'b'political party since 1984 to win a majority and govern with'b'out the support of other parties.[168] The Prime Minister of'b' India is Narendra Modi, who was formerly Chief Minister of 'b'Gujarat.\n\nGovernment\nMain articles: Government of India and 'b'Constitution of India\nIndia is a federation with a parliamen'b'tary system governed under the Constitution of India, which 'b"serves as the country's supreme legal document. It is a cons"b'titutional republic and representative democracy, in which "'b'majority rule is tempered by minority rights protected by la'b'w". Federalism in India defines the power distribution betwe'b'en the federal government and the states. The government abi'b'des by constitutional checks and balances. The Constitution 'b'of India, which came into effect on 26 January 1950,[169] st'b'ates in its preamble that India is a sovereign, socialist, s'b"ecular, democratic republic.[170] India's form of government"b', traditionally described as "quasi-federal" with a strong c'b'entre and weak states,[171] has grown increasingly federal s'b'ince the late 1990s as a result of political, economic, and 'b'social changes.[172][173]\n\nNational symbols[1]\nFlag\tTiranga 'b'(Tricolour)\nEmblem\tSarnath Lion Capital\nLanguage\tNone[8][9]\n'b'Anthem\tJana Gana Mana\nSong\tVande Mataram\nCurrency\t\xe2\x82\xb9 (Indian 'b'rupee)\nCalendar\tSaka\nAnimal\tTiger (land)\nRiver dolphin (aqua'b'tic)\nBird\tIndian peafowl\nFlower\tLotus\nFruit\tMango\nTree\tBanya'b'n\nRiver\tGanga\nGame\tNot declared[174]\nThe federal government 'b'comprises three branches:\n\nExecutive: The President of India'b' is the head of state[175] and is elected indirectly by a na'b'tional electoral college[176] for a five-year term.[177] The'b' Prime Minister of India is the head of government and exerc'b'ises most executive power.[178] Appointed by the president,['b'179] the prime minister is by convention supported by the pa'b'rty or political alliance holding the majority of seats in t'b'he lower house of parliament.[178] The executive branch of t'b'he Indian government consists of the president, the vice-pre'b'sident, and the Council of Ministers\xe2\x80\x94the cabinet being its e'b'xecutive committee\xe2\x80\x94headed by the prime minister. Any ministe'b'r holding a portfolio must be a member of one of the houses 'b'of parliament.[175] In the Indian parliamentary system, the 'b'executive is subordinate to the legislature; the prime minis'b'ter and his council are directly responsible to the lower ho'b'use of the parliament.[180]\nLegislative: The legislature of 'b'India is the bicameral parliament. It operates under a Westm'b'inster-style parliamentary system and comprises the upper ho'b'use called the Rajya Sabha ("Council of States") and the low'b'er called the Lok Sabha ("House of the People").[181] The Ra'b'jya Sabha is a permanent body that has 245 members who serve'b' in staggered six-year terms.[182] Most are elected indirect'b'ly by the state and territorial legislatures in numbers prop'b"ortional to their state's share of the national population.["b"179] All but two of the Lok Sabha's 545 members are directly"b' elected by popular vote; they represent individual constitu'b'encies via five-year terms.[183] The remaining two members a'b're nominated by the president from among the Anglo-Indian co'b'mmunity, in case the president decides that they are not ade'b'quately represented.[184]\nJudicial: India has a unitary thre'b'e-tier independent judiciary[185] that comprises the Supreme'b' Court, headed by the Chief Justice of India, 24 High Courts'b', and a large number of trial courts.[185] The Supreme Court'b' has original jurisdiction over cases involving fundamental 'b'rights and over disputes between states and the centre; it h'b'as appellate jurisdiction over the High Courts.[186] It has 'b'the power both to declare the law and to strike down union o'b'r state laws which contravene the constitution,[187] as well'b' as to invalidate any government action it deems unconstitut'b'ional.[188]\nSubdivisions\nMain article: Administrative divisi'b'ons of India\nSee also: Political integration of India\n \nA cl'b'ickable map of the 29 states and 7 union territories of Indi'b'a\nStates (1\xe2\x80\x9329) & Union territories (A-G)\n1.

The remaining five union territor'b'ies are directly ruled by the centre through appointed admin'b'istrators. In 1956, under the States Reorganisation Act, sta'b'tes were reorganised on a linguistic basis.[190] Since then,'b' their structure has remained largely unchanged. Each state 'b'or union territory is further divided into administrative di'b'stricts. The districts in turn are further divided into tehs'b'ils and ultimately into villages.\n\nForeign relations and mil'b'itary\nMain articles: Foreign relations of India and Indian A'b'rmed Forces\nTwo standing men are pictured shaking hands.

Ind'b'ia and Russia share extensive economic, defence, and technol'b'ogical ties.\nSince its independence in 1947, India has maint'b'ained cordial relations with most nations. In the 1950s, it 'b'strongly supported decolonisation in Africa and Asia and pla'b'yed a lead role in the Non-Aligned Movement.[191] In the lat'b'e 1980s, the Indian military twice intervened abroad at the 'b'invitation of neighbouring countries: a peace-keeping operat'b'ion in Sri Lanka between 1987 and 1990; and an armed interve'b"ntion to prevent a 1988 coup d'\xc3\xa9tat attempt in Maldives. Ind"b'ia has tense relations with neighbouring Pakistan; the two n'b'ations have gone to war four times: in 1947, 1965, 1971, and'b' 1999. Three of these wars were fought over the disputed ter'b'ritory of Kashmir, while the fourth, the 1971 war, followed 'b"from India's support for the independence of Bangladesh.[192"b'] After waging the 1962 Sino-Indian War and the 1965 war wit'b'h Pakistan, India pursued close military and economic ties w'b'ith the Soviet Union; by the late 1960s, the Soviet Union wa'b's its largest arms supplier.[193]\n\nAside from ongoing strate'b'gic relations with Russia, India has wide-ranging defence re'b'lations with Israel and France. In recent years, it has play'b'ed key roles in the South Asian Association for Regional Coo'b'peration and the World Trade Organisation. The nation has pr'b'ovided 100,000 military and police personnel to serve in 35 'b'UN peacekeeping operations across four continents. It partic'b'ipates in the East Asia Summit, the G8+5, and other multilat'b'eral forums.[194] India has close economic ties with South A'b'merica,[195] Asia, and Africa; it pursues a "Look East" poli'b'cy that seeks to strengthen partnerships with the ASEAN nati'b'ons, Japan, and South Korea that revolve around many issues,'b' but especially those involving economic investment and regi'b'onal security.[196][197]\n\n\nINS Vikramaditya, the Indian Navy'b"'s biggest warship.\nChina's nuclear test of 1964, as well as"b' its repeated threats to intervene in support of Pakistan in'b' the 1965 war, convinced India to develop nuclear weapons.[1'b'98] India conducted its first nuclear weapons test in 1974 a'b'nd carried out further underground testing in 1998. Despite 'b'criticism and military sanctions, India has signed neither t'b'he Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty nor the Nuclear Non'b'-Proliferation Treaty, considering both to be flawed and dis'b'criminatory.[199] India maintains a "no first use" nuclear p'b'olicy and is developing a nuclear triad capability as a part'b' of its "minimum credible deterrence" doctrine.[200][201] It'b' is developing a ballistic missile defence shield and, in co'b'llaboration with Russia, a fifth-generation fighter jet.[202'b'] Other indigenous military projects involve the design and 'b'implementation of Vikrant-class aircraft carriers and Arihan'b't-class nuclear submarines.[202]\n\nSince the end of the Cold 'b'War, India has increased its economic, strategic, and milita'b'ry co-operation with the United States and the European Unio'b'n.[203] In 2008, a civilian nuclear agreement was signed bet'b'ween India and the United States. Although India possessed n'b'uclear weapons at the time and was not party to the Nuclear 'b'Non-Proliferation Treaty, it received waivers from the Inter'b'national Atomic Energy Agency and the Nuclear Suppliers Grou'b"p, ending earlier restrictions on India's nuclear technology"b' and commerce. As a consequence, India became the sixth de f'b'acto nuclear weapons state.[204] India subsequently signed c'b'o-operation agreements involving civilian nuclear energy wit'b'h Russia,[205] France,[206] the United Kingdom,[207] and Can'b'ada.[208]\n\nThe President of India is the supreme commander o'b"f the nation's armed forces; with 1.325 million active troop"b"s, they compose the world's third-largest military.[209] It "b'comprises the Indian Army, the Indian Navy, and the Indian A'b'ir Force; auxiliary organisations include the Strategic Forc'b'es Command and three paramilitary groups: the Assam Rifles, 'b'the Special Frontier Force, and the Indian Coast Guard.[210]'b' The official Indian defence budget for 2011 was US$36.03 bi'b'llion, or 1.83% of GDP.[211] For the fiscal year spanning 20'b'12\xe2\x80\x932013, US$40.44 billion was budgeted.[212] According to a 'b"2008 SIPRI report, India's annual military expenditure in te"b'rms of purchasing power stood at US$72.7 billion.[213] In 20'b'11, the annual defence budget increased by 11.6%,[214] altho'b'ugh this does not include funds that reach the military thro'b'ugh other branches of government.[215] As of 2012, India is 'b"the world's largest arms importer; between 2007 and 2011, it"b' accounted for 10% of funds spent on international arms purc'b'hases.[216] Much of the military expenditure was focused on 'b'defence against Pakistan and countering growing Chinese infl'b'uence in the Indian Ocean.[214]\n\nEconomy\nMain article: Econo'b'my of India\nSee also: Economic History of India and Economic'b' development in India\n\nA daily wage worker in a salt field. 'b'The average minimum wage of daily labourers is around Rs.100'b' per day\nAccording to the International Monetary Fund (IMF),'b' the Indian economy in 2017 was nominally worth US$2.454 tri'b'llion; it is the sixth-largest economy by market exchange ra'b'tes, and is, at US$9.489 trillion, the third-largest by purc'b'hasing power parity, or PPP.[15] With its average annual GDP'b' growth rate of 5.8% over the past two decades, and reaching'b" 6.1% during 2011\xe2\x80\x9312,[217] India is one of the world's faste"b'st-growing economies.[218] However, the country ranks 140th 'b'in the world in nominal GDP per capita and 129th in GDP per 'b'capita at PPP.[219] Until 1991, all Indian governments follo'b'wed protectionist policies that were influenced by socialist'b' economics. Widespread state intervention and regulation lar'b'gely walled the economy off from the outside world. An acute'b' balance of payments crisis in 1991 forced the nation to lib'b'eralise its economy;[220] since then it has slowly moved tow'b'ards a free-market system[221][222] by emphasising both fore'b'ign trade and direct investment inflows.[223] India has been'b' a member of WTO since 1 January 1995.[224]\n\nThe 486.6-milli'b"on-worker Indian labour force is the world's second-largest,"b' as of 2011.[210] The service sector makes up 55.6% of GDP, 'b'the industrial sector 26.3% and the agricultural sector 18.1'b"%. India's foreign exchange remittances of US$70 billion in "b'2014, the largest in the world, contributed to its economy b'b'y 25 million Indians working in foreign countries.[225] Majo'b'r agricultural products include rice, wheat, oilseed, cotton'b', jute, tea, sugarcane, and potatoes.[189] Major industries 'b'include textiles, telecommunications, chemicals, pharmaceuti'b'cals, biotechnology, food processing, steel, transport equip'b'ment, cement, mining, petroleum, machinery, and software.[18'b"9] In 2006, the share of external trade in India's GDP stood"b" at 24%, up from 6% in 1985.[221] In 2008, India's share of "b"world trade was 1.68%;[226] In 2011, India was the world's t"b'enth-largest importer and the nineteenth-largest exporter.[2'b'27] Major exports include petroleum products, textile goods,'b' jewellery, software, engineering goods, chemicals, and leat'b'her manufactures.[189] Major imports include crude oil, mach'b'inery, gems, fertiliser, and chemicals.[189] Between 2001 an'b'd 2011, the contribution of petrochemical and engineering go'b'ods to total exports grew from 14% to 42%.[228] India was th'b'e second largest textile exporter after China in the world i'b'n calendar year 2013.[229]\n\nAveraging an economic growth rat'b'e of 7.5% for several years prior to 2007,[221] India has mo'b're than doubled its hourly wage rates during the first decad'b'e of the 21st century.[230] Some 431 million Indians have le'b"ft poverty since 1985; India's middle classes are projected "b'to number around 580 million by 2030.[231] Though ranking 51'b'st in global competitiveness, India ranks 17th in financial 'b'market sophistication, 24th in the banking sector, 44th in b'b'usiness sophistication, and 39th in innovation, ahead of sev'b'eral advanced economies, as of 2010.[232] With 7 of the worl'b"d's top 15 information technology outsourcing companies base"b'd in India, the country is viewed as the second-most favoura'b'ble outsourcing destination after the United States, as of 2'b"009.[233] India's consumer market, the world's eleventh-larg"b'est, is expected to become fifth-largest by 2030.[231]\n\nDriv'b"en by growth, India's nominal GDP per capita has steadily in"b'creased from US$329 in 1991, when economic liberalisation be'b'gan, to US$1,265 in 2010, and is estimated to increase to US'b'$2,110 by 2016; however, it has remained lower than those of'b' other Asian developing countries such as Indonesia, Malaysi'b'a, Philippines, Sri Lanka, and Thailand, and is expected to 'b'remain so in the near future. However, it is higher than Pak'b'istan, Nepal, Afghanistan, Bangladesh and others.[234]\n\nAcco'b"rding to a 2011 PricewaterhouseCoopers report, India's GDP a"b't purchasing power parity could overtake that of the United 'b'States by 2045.[235] During the next four decades, Indian GD'b'P is expected to grow at an annualised average of 8%, making'b" it potentially the world's fastest-growing major economy un"b'til 2050.[235] The report highlights key growth factors: a y'b'oung and rapidly growing working-age population; growth in t'b'he manufacturing sector because of rising education and engi'b'neering skill levels; and sustained growth of the consumer m'b'arket driven by a rapidly growing middle class.[235] The Wor'b'ld Bank cautions that, for India to achieve its economic pot'b'ential, it must continue to focus on public sector reform, t'b'ransport infrastructure, agricultural and rural development,'b' removal of labour regulations, education, energy security, 'b'and public health and nutrition.[236]\n\nAccording to the Worl'b'dwide Cost of Living Report 2017 released by the Economist I'b'ntelligence Unit (EIU) which was created by comparing more t'b'han 400 individual prices across 160 products and services, 'b'four of the cheapest cities were in India: Bangalore (3rd), 'b'Chennai (6th), Mumbai (7th) and New Delhi (9th).[237]\n\nSecto'b'rs\nStreet-level view looking up at a modern 30-story buildin'b"g.\nThe Bombay Stock Exchange is Asia's oldest and India's la"b"rgest bourse by market capitalisation.\nIndia's telecommunica"b"tion industry, the world's fastest-growing, added 227 millio"b'n subscribers during the period 2010\xe2\x80\x9311,[238] and after the 'b'first quarter of 2013, India surpassed Japan to become the t'b'hird-largest smartphone market in the world after China and 'b"the US.[239]\n\nThe Indian automotive industry, the world's se"b'cond fastest growing, increased domestic sales by 26% during'b' 2009\xe2\x80\x9310,[240] and exports by 36% during 2008\xe2\x80\x9309.[241] India'b"'s capacity to generate electrical power is 250 gigawatts, o"b'f which 8% is renewable.

The slowing down of the overall grow'b'th rate of population was due to the sharp decline in the gr'b'owth rate in rural areas since 1991.[275] According to the 2'b'011 census, there are 53 million-plus urban agglomerations i'b'n India; among them Mumbai, Delhi, Kolkata, Chennai, Bangalo'b're, Hyderabad and Ahmedabad, in decreasing order by populati'b'on.[276] The literacy rate in 2011 was 74.04%: 65.46% among 'b'females and 82.14% among males.[277] The rural urban literac'b'y gap which was 21.2 percentage points in 2001, dropped to 1'b'6.1 percentage points in 2011. The improvement in literacy r'b'ate in rural area is two times that in urban areas.[275] Ker'b'ala is the most literate state with 93.91% literacy; while B'b'ihar the least with 63.82%.[277]\n\nIndia is home to two major'b' language families: Indo-Aryan (spoken by about 74% of the p'b'opulation) and Dravidian (spoken by 24% of the population). 'b'Other languages spoken in India come from the Austroasiatic 'b'and Sino-Tibetan language families. India has no national la'b'nguage.[278] Hindi, with the largest number of speakers, is 'b'the official language of the government.[279][280] English i'b's used extensively in business and administration and has th'b'e status of a "subsidiary official language";[4] it is impor'b'tant in education, especially as a medium of higher educatio'b'n. Each state and union territory has one or more official l'b'anguages, and the constitution recognises in particular 22 "'b'scheduled languages". The Constitution of India recognises 2'b'12 scheduled tribal groups which together constitute about 7'b".5% of the country's population.[281] The 2011 census report"b'ed that the religion in India with the largest number of fol'b'lowers was Hinduism (79.80% of the population), followed by 'b'Islam (14.23%); the remaining were Christianity (2.30%), Sik'b'hism (1.72%), Buddhism (0.70%), Jainism (0.36%) and others[c'b"] (0.9%).[10] India has the world's largest Hindu, Sikh, Jai"b"n, Zoroastrian, and Bah\xc3\xa1'\xc3\xad populations, and has the third-la"b'rgest Muslim population\xe2\x80\x94the largest for a non-Muslim majorit'b'y country.[282][283]\n\nCulture\nMain article: Culture of India'b'\n\nA Chola bronze depicting Nataraja, who is seen as a cosmic'b' "Lord of the Dance" and representative of Shiva\nIndian cult'b'ural history spans more than 4,500 years.[284] During the Ve'b'dic period (c. 1700 \xe2\x80\x93 500 BCE), the foundations of Hindu phi'b'losophy, mythology, theology and literature were laid, and m'b'any beliefs and practices which still exist today, such as d'b'h\xc3\xa1rma, k\xc3\xa1rma, y\xc3\xb3ga, and mok\xe1\xb9\xa3a, were established.[20] India i'b's notable for its religious diversity, with Hinduism, Buddhi'b'sm, Sikhism, Islam, Christianity, and Jainism among the nati'b"on's major religions.[285] The predominant religion, Hinduis"b'm, has been shaped by various historical schools of thought,'b' including those of the Upanishads,[286] the Yoga Sutras, th'b'e Bhakti movement,[285] and by Buddhist philosophy.[287]\n\nAr'b't and architecture\nMain article: Architecture of India\nMuch 'b'of Indian architecture, including the Taj Mahal, other works'b' of Mughal architecture, and South Indian architecture, blen'b'ds ancient local traditions with imported styles.[288] Verna'b'cular architecture is also highly regional in it flavours. V'b'astu shastra, literally "science of construction" or "archit'b'ecture" and ascribed to Mamuni Mayan,[289] explores how the 'b'laws of nature affect human dwellings;[290] it employs preci'b'se geometry and directional alignments to reflect perceived 'b'cosmic constructs.[291] As applied in Hindu temple architect'b'ure, it is influenced by the Shilpa Shastras, a series of fo'b'undational texts whose basic mythological form is the Vastu-'b'Purusha mandala, a square that embodied the "absolute".[292]'b' The Taj Mahal, built in Agra between 1631 and 1648 by order'b's of Emperor Shah Jahan in memory of his wife, has been desc'b'ribed in the UNESCO World Heritage List as "the jewel of Mus'b'lim art in India and one of the universally admired masterpi'b'eces of the world\'s heritage".[293] Indo-Saracenic Revival a'b'rchitecture, developed by the British in the late 19th centu'b'ry, drew on Indo-Islamic architecture.[294]\n\nLiterature\nMain'b' article: Indian literature\nThe earliest literary writings i'b'n India, composed between 1700 BCE and 1200 CE, were in the 'b'Sanskrit language.[295][296] Prominent works of this Sanskri'b't literature include epics such as the Mah\xc4\x81bh\xc4\x81rata and the R'b'amayana, the dramas of K\xc4\x81lid\xc4\x81sa such as the Abhij\xc3\xb1\xc4\x81na\xc5\x9b\xc4\x81kunta'b'lam (The Recognition of \xc5\x9aakuntal\xc4\x81), and poetry such as the M'b'ah\xc4\x81k\xc4\x81vya.[297][298][299] Kamasutra, the famous book about se'b'xual intercourse also originated in India. Developed between'b' 600 BCE and 300 CE in South India, the Sangam literature, c'b'onsisting of 2,381 poems, is regarded as a predecessor of Ta'b'mil literature.[300][301][302][303] From the 14th to the 18t'b"h centuries, India's literary traditions went through a peri"b'od of drastic change because of the emergence of devotional 'b'poets such as Kab\xc4\xabr, Tuls\xc4\xabd\xc4\x81s, and Guru N\xc4\x81nak. This period w'b'as characterised by a varied and wide spectrum of thought an'b'd expression; as a consequence, medieval Indian literary wor'b'ks differed significantly from classical traditions.[304] In'b' the 19th century, Indian writers took a new interest in soc'b'ial questions and psychological descriptions. In the 20th ce'b'ntury, Indian literature was influenced by the works of Beng'b'ali poet and novelist Rabindranath Tagore,[305] who was a re'b'cipient of the Nobel Prize in Literature.\n\nPerforming arts\n\n'b'Sarod performance at the Mus\xc3\xa9e Guimet, Paris\nMain articles: 'b'Music of India and Dance in India\nIndian music ranges over v'b'arious traditions and regional styles. Classical music encom'b'passes two genres and their various folk offshoots: the nort'b'hern Hindustani and southern Carnatic schools.[306] Regional'b'ised popular forms include filmi and folk music; the syncret'b'ic tradition of the bauls is a well-known form of the latter'b'. Indian dance also features diverse folk and classical form'b's. Among the better-known folk dances are the bhangra of Pun'b'jab, the bihu of Assam, the chhau of Odisha, West Bengal and'b' Jharkhand, garba and dandiya of Gujarat, ghoomar of Rajasth'b'an, and the lavani of Maharashtra. Eight dance forms, many w'b'ith narrative forms and mythological elements, have been acc'b"orded classical dance status by India's National Academy of "b'Music, Dance, and Drama. These are: bharatanatyam of the sta'b'te of Tamil Nadu, kathak of Uttar Pradesh, kathakali and moh'b'iniyattam of Kerala, kuchipudi of Andhra Pradesh, manipuri o'b'f Manipur, odissi of Odisha, and the sattriya of Assam.[307]'b' Theatre in India melds music, dance, and improvised or writ'b'ten dialogue.[308] Often based on Hindu mythology, but also 'b'borrowing from medieval romances or social and political eve'b'nts, Indian theatre includes the bhavai of Gujarat, the jatr'b'a of West Bengal, the nautanki and ramlila of North India, t'b'amasha of Maharashtra, burrakatha of Andhra Pradesh, terukku'b'ttu of Tamil Nadu, and the yakshagana of Karnataka.[309]\n\nMo'b'tion pictures, television\nMain articles: Cinema of India and'b' Television in India\nThe Indian film industry produces the w'b"orld's most-watched cinema.[310] Established regional cinema"b'tic traditions exist in the Assamese, Bengali, Bhojpuri, Hin'b'di, Kannada, Malayalam, Punjabi, Gujarati, Marathi, Odia, Ta'b'mil, and Telugu languages.[311] South Indian cinema attracts'b' more than 75% of national film revenue.[312]\n\nTelevision br'b'oadcasting began in India in 1959 as a state-run medium of c'b'ommunication, and had slow expansion for more than two decad'b'es.[313][314] The state monopoly on television broadcast end'b'ed in the 1990s and, since then, satellite channels have inc'b'reasingly shaped popular culture of Indian society.[315] Tod'b'ay, television is the most penetrative media in India; indus'b'try estimates indicate that as of 2012 there are over 554 mi'b'llion TV consumers, 462 million with satellite and/or cable 'b'connections, compared to other forms of mass media such as p'b'ress (350 million), radio (156 million) or internet (37 mill'b'ion).[316]\n\nCuisine\nMain article: Indian cuisine\n\nAn assortm'b'ent of Indian spices\nIndian cuisine encompasses a wide varie'b'ty of regional and traditional cuisines, often depending on 'b'a particular state (such as Maharashtrian cuisine). Staple f'b'oods of Indian cuisine include pearl millet (b\xc4\x81jra), rice, w'b'hole-wheat flour (a\xe1\xb9\xad\xe1\xb9\xada), and a variety of lentils, such as m'b'asoor (most often red lentils), toor (pigeon peas), urad (bl'b'ack gram), and mong (mung beans). Lentils may be used whole,'b' dehusked\xe2\x80\x94for example, dhuli moong or dhuli urad\xe2\x80\x94or split. S'b'plit lentils, or dal, are used extensively.[317] The spice t'b'rade between India and Europe is often cited by historians a'b"s the primary catalyst for Europe's Age of Discovery.[318]\n\n"b'Society\nMain article: Culture of India\n\nFour activities of a'b' Hindu priest, clockwise from top left: (1) preparing the de'b'ity for public worship; (2) making sandalwood paste for ritu'b'al blessing; (3) successively dripping the altar with milk, 'b'honey, dry fruit, yoghurt, and bananas to make ambrosia; (4)'b' distributing the prasad, food viewed as blessed by the deit'b'y, to the worshipers.\nTraditional Indian society is sometime'b's defined by social hierarchy. The Indian caste system embod'b'ies much of the social stratification and many of the social'b' restrictions found in the Indian subcontinent. Social class'b'es are defined by thousands of endogamous hereditary groups,'b' often termed as j\xc4\x81tis, or "castes".[319] India declared unt'b'ouchability to be illegal[320] in 1947 and has since enacted'b' other anti-discriminatory laws and social welfare initiativ'b'es. At the workplace in urban India and in international or 'b'leading Indian companies, the caste related identification h'b'as pretty much lost its importance.[321][322]\n\nFamily values'b' are important in the Indian tradition, and multi-generation'b'al patriarchal joint families have been the norm in India, t'b'hough nuclear families are becoming common in urban areas.[3'b'23] An overwhelming majority of Indians, with their consent,'b' have their marriages arranged by their parents or other eld'b'ers in the family.[324] Marriage is thought to be for life,['b'324] and the divorce rate is extremely low.[325] As of 2001,'b' just 1.6 percent of Indian women were divorced but this fig'b'ure was rising due to their education and economic independe'b'nce.[325] Child marriages are common, especially in rural ar'b'eas; many women wed before reaching 18, which is their legal'b' marriageable age.[326] Female infanticide and female foetic'b'ide in the country have caused a discrepancy in the sex rati'b'o, as of 2005 it was estimated that there were 50 million mo'b're males than females in the nation.[327][328] However a rep'b'ort from 2011 has shown improvement in the gender ratio.[329'b'] The payment of dowry, although illegal, remains widespread'b' across class lines.[330] Deaths resulting from dowry, mostl'b'y from bride burning, are on the rise.[331]\n\nMany Indian fes'b'tivals are religious in origin. The best known include Diwal'b'i, Ganesh Chaturthi, Thai Pongal, Holi, Durga Puja, Eid ul-F'b'itr, Bakr-Id, Christmas, and Vaisakhi.[332][333] India has t'b'hree national holidays which are observed in all states and 'b'union territories \xe2\x80\x93 Republic Day, Independence Day and Gandh'b'i Jayanti. Other sets of holidays, varying between nine and 'b'twelve, are officially observed in individual states.\n\nCloth'b'ing\nMain article: Clothing in India\nCotton was domesticated 'b'in India by 4000 BCE. Traditional Indian dress varies in col'b'our and style across regions and depends on various factors,'b' including climate and faith. Popular styles of dress includ'b'e draped garments such as the sari for women and the dhoti o'b'r lungi for men. Stitched clothes, such as the shalwar kamee'b'z for women and kurta\xe2\x80\x93pyjama combinations or European-style 'b'trousers and shirts for men, are also popular.[334] Use of d'b'elicate jewellery, modelled on real flowers worn in ancient 'b'India, is part of a tradition dating back some 5,000 years; 'b'gemstones are also worn in India as talismans.[335]\n\nSports\n'b'Main article: Sport in India\n\nA street-corner game of pachis'b'i in Pushkar, Rajasthan\nIn India, several traditional indige'b'nous sports remain fairly popular, such as kabaddi, kho kho,'b' pehlwani and gilli-danda. Some of the earliest forms of Asi'b'an martial arts, such as kalarippayattu, musti yuddha, silam'b'bam, and marma adi, originated in India. Chess, commonly hel'b'd to have originated in India as chatura\xe1\xb9\x85ga, is regaining wi'b'despread popularity with the rise in the number of Indian gr'b'andmasters.[336][337] Pachisi, from which parcheesi derives,'b' was played on a giant marble court by Akbar.[338]\n\nThe impr'b'oved results garnered by the Indian Davis Cup team and other'b' Indian tennis players in the early 2010s have made tennis i'b'ncreasingly popular in the country.[339] India has a compara'b'tively strong presence in shooting sports, and has won sever'b'al medals at the Olympics, the World Shooting Championships,'b' and the Commonwealth Games.[340][341] Other sports in which'b' Indians have succeeded internationally include badminton[34'b'2] (Saina Nehwal and P V Sindhu are two of the top ranked fe'b'male badminton players in the world), boxing,[343] and wrest'b'ling.[344] Football is popular in West Bengal, Goa, Tamil Na'b'du, Kerala, and the north-eastern states.[345] India is sche'b'duled to host the 2017 FIFA U-17 World Cup.[346]\n\nField hock'b'ey in India is administered by Hockey India. The Indian nati'b'onal hockey team won the 1975 Hockey World Cup and have, as 'b'of 2016, taken eight gold, one silver, and two bronze Olympi'b"c medals, making it the sport's most successful team in the "b'Olympics.\n\nIndia has also played a major role in popularisin'b'g cricket. Thus, cricket is, by far, the most popular sport 'b'in India. The Indian national cricket team won the 1983 and 'b'2011 Cricket World Cup events, the 2007 ICC World Twenty20, 'b'shared the 2002 ICC Champions Trophy with Sri Lanka, and won'b' 2013 ICC Champions Trophy. Cricket in India is administered'b' by the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI); the Ra'b'nji Trophy, the Duleep Trophy, the Deodhar Trophy, the Irani'b' Trophy, and the NKP Salve Challenger Trophy are domestic co'b'mpetitions. The BCCI also conducts an annual Twenty20 compet'b'ition known as the Indian Premier League.\n\nIndia has hosted 'b'or co-hosted several international sporting events: the 1951'b' and 1982 Asian Games; the 1987, 1996, and 2011 Cricket Worl'b'd Cup tournaments; the 2003 Afro-Asian Games; the 2006 ICC C'b'hampions Trophy; the 2010 Hockey World Cup; and the 2010 Com'b'monwealth Games. Major international sporting events held an'b'nually in India include the Chennai Open, the Mumbai Maratho'b'n, the Delhi Half Marathon, and the Indian Masters. The firs'b't Formula 1 Indian Grand Prix featured in late 2011 but has 'b'been discontinued from the F1 season calendar since 2014.[34'b'7]\n\nIndia has traditionally been the dominant country at the'b' South Asian Games. An example of this dominance is the bask'b'etball competition where Team India won three out of four to'b'urnaments to date.[348]\n\nThe Rajiv Gandhi Khel Ratna and the'b' Arjuna Award are the highest forms of government recognitio'b'n for athletic achievement; the Dronacharya Award is awarded'b' for excellence in coaching.\n\nSee also\n\tIndia portal\nicon\tAs'b'ia portal\nOutline of India\nIndex of India-related articles\nN'b'otes\nJump up ^ "[...] Jana Gana Mana is the National Anthem 'b'of India, subject to such alterations in the words as the Go'b'vernment may authorise as occasion arises; and the song Vand'b'e Mataram, which has played a historic part in the struggle 'b'for Indian freedom, shall be honoured equally with Jana Gana'b' Mana and shall have equal status with it."

It is the sixth-mo'b'st populous country with a population exceeding 201 million 'b'people.[24] In terms of area, it is the 33rd-largest country'b' spanning 881,913 square kilometres (340,509 square miles). 'b'Pakistan has a 1,046-kilometre (650-mile) coastline along th'b'e Arabian Sea and its Gulf of Oman in the south and is borde'b'red by India to the east, Afghanistan to the west, Iran to t'b'he southwest, and China in the far northeast, respectively. 'b"It is separated from Tajikistan by Afghanistan's narrow Wakh"b'an Corridor in the north, and also shares a maritime border 'b'with Oman.\n\nThe territory that now constitutes Pakistan is c'b'onsidered a cradle of civilisation[25][26][27][28][29] that 'b'was previously home to several ancient cultures, including t'b'he Mehrgarh of the Neolithic and the Bronze Age Indus Valley'b' Civilisation, and later home to kingdoms ruled by people of'b' different faiths and cultures, including Hindus, Indo-Greek'b's, Muslims, Turco-Mongols, Afghans, and Sikhs. The area has 'b'been ruled by numerous empires and dynasties, including the 'b'Persian Achaemenid Empire, Alexander of Macedonia, the India'b'n Mauryan Empire, the Arab Umayyad Caliphate, the Delhi Sult'b'anate, the Mongol Empire, the Mughal Empire, the Durrani Emp'b'ire, the Sikh Empire, and most recently, the British Empire.'b'\n\nPakistan is unique among Muslim countries in that it is th'b'e only country to have been created in the name of Islam.[30'b'][31] As a result of the Pakistan Movement led by Muhammad A'b"li Jinnah and the subcontinent's struggle for independence, "b'Pakistan was created in 1947 as an indepenland for South Asi'b'an Muslims.[32] It is an ethnically and linguistically diver'b'se country, with a similarly diverse geography and wildlife.'b' Initially a dominion, Pakistan adopted a constitution in 19'b'56, becoming an Islamic republic. An ethnic civil war in 197'b'1 resulted in the secession of East Pakistan as the new coun'b'try of Bangladesh. In 1973 Pakistan adopted a new constituti'b'on establishing, alongside its pre-existing parliamentary re'b'public status, a federal government based in Islamabad consi'b'sting of four provinces and four federal territories. The ne'b'w constitution also stipulated that all laws were to conform'b' to the injunctions of Islam as laid down in the Quran and S'b'unnah.[33]\n\nA regional[34][35][36] and middle power,[37][38]'b'[39] Pakistan has the sixth-largest standing armed forces in'b' the world and is also a nuclear power as well as a declared'b' nuclear-weapons state, being the second in South Asia and t'b'he only nation in the Muslim world to have that status. Paki'b'stan has a semi-industrialised economy with a well-integrate'b'd agriculture sector, and a growing services sector.[40][41]'b' The Pakistani economy is the 24th-largest in the world in t'b'erms of purchasing power and the 41st-largest in terms of no'b'minal GDP (World Bank). It is ranked among the emerging and 'b'growth-leading economies of the world,[42][43] and is backed'b" by one of the world's largest and fastest-growing middle cl"b'asses.[44][45]\n\nThe post-independence history of Pakistan ha'b's been characterised by periods of military rule, and since 'b'2008 a transition to democracy, amid conflicts with neighbou'b'ring India. The country continues to face challenging proble'b'ms such as illiteracy, healthcare, and corruption, but has s'b'ubstantially reduced poverty[46] and terrorism[47] and expan'b'ded per capita income.[48] Pakistan is a member of the Unite'b'd Nations, the Non-Aligned Movement, the Organisation of Isl'b'amic Cooperation, the Commonwealth of Nations, the ECO, the 'b'SAARC, the Developing Eight, and the G20 developing nations,'b' Group of 24, Group of 77, and ECOSOC. It is also an associa'b'te member of CERN. Pakistan is a signatory to the Kyoto Prot'b'ocol, the Paris Agreement, and the International Covenant on'b' Civil and Political Rights.At its zenith, the Rai Dynasty ('b'489\xe2\x80\x93632 AD) of Sindh ruled this region and the surrounding t'b'erritories.[70] The Pala Dynasty was the last Buddhist empir'b'e, which, under Dharmapala and Devapala, stretched across So'b'uth Asia from what is now Bangladesh through Northern India 'b'to Pakistan.\n\nThe Arab conqueror Muhammad bin Qasim conquere'b'd the Indus valley from Sindh to Multan in southern Punjab i'b"n 711 AD.[71][72][73][74][75] The Pakistan government's offi"b'cial chronology identifies this as the time when the foundat'b'ion of Pakistan was laid.[71][76][77] The Early Medieval per'b'iod (642\xe2\x80\x931219 AD) witnessed the spread of Islam in the regio'b'n. During this period, Sufi missionaries played a pivotal ro'b'le in converting a majority of the regional Buddhist and Hin'b'du population to Islam.[78] These developments set the stage'b' for the rule of several successive Muslim empires in the re'b'gion, including the Ghaznavid Empire (975\xe2\x80\x931187 AD), the Ghor'b'id Kingdom, and the Delhi Sultanate (1206\xe2\x80\x931526 AD). The Lodi'b' dynasty, the last of the Delhi Sultanate, was replaced by t'b'he Mughal Empire (1526\xe2\x80\x931857 AD). The Mughals introduced Pers'b'ian literature and high culture, establishing the roots of I'b'ndo-Persian culture in the region.[79] From the region of mo'b'dern-day Pakistan, key cities during the Mughal rule were La'b'hore and Thatta,[80] both of which were chosen as the site o'b'f impressive Mughal buildings.[81] In the early 16th century'b', the region remained under the Mughal Empire ruled by Musli'b'm emperors.[82] By the early 18th century, increasing Europe'b'an influence contributed to the slow disintegration of the e'b'mpire as the lines between commercial and political dominanc'b'e became increasingly blurred.[82]\n\n\nEdwin Lord Weeks illust'b'ration of an open-air restaurant near Wazir Khan Mosque, Lah'b'ore\nDuring this time, the English East India Company had est'b'ablished coastal outposts.[82] Control over the seas, greate'b'r resources, technology, and British military protection led'b' the Company to increasingly flex its military muscle, allow'b'ing the Company to gain control over the subcontinent by 176'b'5 and sideline European competitors.[83] Expanding access be'b'yond Bengal and the subsequent increased strength and size o'b'f its army enabled it to annex or subdue most of region by t'b'he 1820s.[82] Many historians see this as the start of the r'b"egion's colonial period.[82] By this time, with its economic"b' power severely curtailed by the British parliament and itse'b'lf effectively made an arm of British administration, the Co'b'mpany began more deliberately to enter non-economic arenas s'b'uch as education, social reform, and culture.[82] Such refor'b'ms included the enforcement of the English Education Act in 'b'1835 and the introduction of the Indian Civil Service (ICS).'b'[84] Traditional madrasahs \xe2\x80\x94 primary institutions of higher 'b'learning for Muslims in the subcontinent \xe2\x80\x94 were no longer su'b'pported by the English Crown, and nearly all of the madrasah'b's lost their financial endowment.[85]\n\nColonial period\nMain 'b'articles: Pakistan Movement, Aligarh Movement, and British R'b'aj\n\nSir Syed Ahmad Khan (1817\xe2\x80\x931898), whose vision formed the'b' basis of Pakistan\n\nMuhammad Ali Jinnah (1876\xe2\x80\x931948) served a'b"s Pakistan's first Governor-General and the leader of the Pa"b'kistan Movement\nThe gradual decline of the Mughal Empire in 'b'the early 18th century enabled the Sikh Empire to control la'b'rger areas until the British East India Company gained ascen'b'dancy over the Indian subcontinent.[86] A rebellion in 1857 'b"called the Sepoy mutiny was the region's major armed struggl"b'e against the British Empire and Queen Victoria.[87] Diverge'b'nce in the relationship between Hinduism and Islam created a'b' major rift in British India that led to racially motivated 'b'religious violence in India.[88] The language controversy fu'b'rther escalated the tensions between Hindus and Muslims.[89]'b' The Hindu renaissance witnessed an awakening of intellectua'b'lism in traditional Hinduism and saw the emergence of more a'b'ssertive influence in the social and political sindependence'b' struggle led by the Indian Congress engaged millions of pro'b'testers in mass campaigns of civil disobedience in the 1920s'b' and 1930s against the British Empire.[95][96][97]\n\n\nOver 10'b' million people were uprooted from their homeland and travel'b'led on foot, bullock carts, and trains to their promised new'b' home during the Partition of India. During the partition, b'b'etween 200,000 to 2,000,000 people were killed in the retrib'b'utive genocide.[98]\nThe Muslim League slowly rose to mass po'b'pularity in the 1930s amid fears of under-representation and'b' neglect of Muslims in politics. In his presidential address'b' of 29 December 1930, Allama Iqbal called for "the amalgamat'b'ion of North-West Muslim-majority Indian states" consisting 'b'of Punjab, North-West Frontier Province, Sindh, and Balochis'b'tan.[99] Muhammad Ali Jinnah, the founder of Pakistan, great'b'ly espoused the two-nation theory and led the Muslim League 'b'to adopt the Lahore Resolution of 1940, popularly known as t'b'he Pakistan Resolution.[86] In World War II, Jinnah and Brit'b'ish-educated founding fathers in the Muslim League supported'b" the United Kingdom's war efforts, countering opposition aga"b"inst it whilst working towards Sir Syed's vision.[100]\n\nThe "b'1946 elections resulted in the Muslim League winning 90 perc'b'ent of the seats reserved for Muslims. Thus, the 1946 electi'b'on was effectively a plebiscite in which the Indian Muslims 'b'were to vote on the creation of Pakistan, a plebiscite won b'b'y the Muslim League.[101] This victory was assisted by the s'b'upport given to the Muslim League by the rural peasantry of 'b'Bengal as well as the support of the landowners of Sindh and'b' Punjab. The Congress, which initially denied the Muslim Lea'b"gue's claim of being the sole representative of Indian Musli"b'ms, was now forced to recognise the fact.[101] The British h'b"ad no alternative except to take Jinnah's views into account"b" as he had emerged as the sole spokesperson of India's Musli"b'ms. However, the British did not want India to be partitione'b'd, and in one last effort to prevent it they devised the Cab'b'inet Mission plan.[102]\n\nAs the cabinet mission failed, the 'b'British government announced its intention to end the Britis'b'h Raj in India in 1946\xe2\x80\x9347.[103] Nationalists in British Indi'b'a \xe2\x80\x94 including Jawaharlal Nehru and Abul Kalam Azad of Congre'b'ss, Jinnah of the All-India Muslim League, and Master Tara S'b'ingh representing the Sikhs \xe2\x80\x94 agreed to the proposed terms o'b'f transfer of power and independence in June 1947 with the V'b'iceroy of India, Lord Mountbatten of Burma.[104] As the Unit'b'ed Kingdom agreed to the partitioning of India in 1947, the 'b'modern state of Pakistan was established on 14 August 1947 ('b'27th of Ramadan in 1366 of the Islamic Calendar), amalgamati'b'ng the Muslim-majority eastern and northwestern regions of B'b'ritish India.[97] It comprised the provinces of Balochistan,'b' East Bengal, the North-West Frontier Province, West Punjab,'b' and Sindh.[86][104]\n\nIn the riots that accompanied the part'b'ition in Punjab Province, it is believed that between 200,00'b'0 and 2,000,000[105][106][107][108][109][110] people were ki'b'lled in what some have described as a retributive genocide b'b'etween the religions[111][112] while 50,000 Muslim women wer'b'e abducted and raped by Hindu and Sikh men and 33,000 Hindu 'b'and Sikh women also experienced the same fate at the hands o'b'f Muslims.[113][114][115][116] Around 6.5 million Muslims mo'b'ved from India to West Pakistan and 4.7 million Hindus and S'b'ikhs moved from West Pakistan to India.[117] It was the larg'b'est mass migration in human history.[118][119][120] Dispute 'b'over Jammu and Kashmir led to the First Kashmir War in 1948.'b'[121][122]\n\nIndependence and modern Pakistan\nMain articles: 'b'Dominion of Pakistan and History of Pakistan\nFile:Pakistan.o'b'gv\nThe American CIA film on Pakistan made in 1950 examines t'b'he history and geography of Pakistan.\n"You are free; you are'b' free to go to your temples, you are free to go to your mosq'b'ues or to any other place or worship in this State of Pakist'b'an.

Mawdudi demanded that the Co'b'nstituent Assembly make an explicit declaration affirming th'b'e "supreme sovereignty of God" and the supremacy of the shar'b'iah in Pakistan.[130]\n\nA significant result of the efforts o'b'f the Jamaat-i-Islami and the ulama was the passage of the O'b'bjectives Resolution in March 1949. The Objectives Resolutio'b'n, which Liaquat Ali Khan called the second most important s'b'tep in Pakistan\'s history, declared that "sovereignty over t'b'he entire universe belongs to God Almighty alone and the aut'b'hority which He has delegated to the State of Pakistan throu'b'gh its people for being exercised within the limits prescrib'b'ed by Him is a sacred trust". The Objectives Resolution has 'b'been incorporated as a preamble to the constitutions of 1956'b', 1962, and 1973.[131]\n\nDemocracy was stalled by the martial'b' law that had been enforced by President Iskander Mirza, who'b' was replaced by army chief, General Ayub Khan. After adopti'b'ng a presidential system in 1962, the country experienced ex'b'ceptional growth until a second war with India in 1965 that 'b'led to an economic downturn and wide-scale public disapprova'b'l in 1967.[132][133] Consolidating control from Ayub Khan in'b' 1969, President Yahya Khan had to deal with a devastating c'b'yclone that caused 500,000 deaths in East Pakistan.[134]\n\n\nS'b'igning of the Tashkent Declaration to end hostilities with I'b'ndia in 1965 in Tashkent, USSR, by President Ayub alongside 'b'Bhutto (centre) and Aziz Ahmed (left)\nIn 1970 Pakistan held 'b'its first democratic elections since independence, meant to 'b'mark a transition from military rule to democracy, but after'b' the East Pakistani Awami League won against the Pakistan Pe'b'oples Party (PPP), Yahya Khan and the military establishment'b' refused to hand over power.[135][136] Operation Searchlight'b', a military crackdown on the Bengali nationalist movement, 'b'led to a declaration of independence and the waging of a war'b' of liberation by the Bengali Mukti Bahini forces in East Pa'b'kistan, with support from India.[136][137] However, in West 'b'Pakistan the conflict was described as a civil war as oppose'b'd to a war of liberation.[138]\n\nIndependent researchers esti'b'mate that between 300,000 and 500,000 civilians died during 'b'this period while the Bangladesh government puts the number 'b'of dead at three million,[139] a figure that is now nearly u'b'niversally regarded as excessively inflated.[140] Some acade'b'mics such as Rudolph Rummel and Rounaq Jahan say both sides['b'141] committed genocide; others such as Richard Sisson and L'b'eo E. Rose believe there was no genocide.[142] In response t'b"o India's support for the insurgency in East Pakistan, preem"b"ptive strikes on India by Pakistan's air force, navy, and ma"b'rines sparked a conventional war in 1971 that resulted in an'b' Indian victory and East Pakistan gaining independence as Ba'b'ngladesh.[136]\n\nWith Pakistan surrendering in the war, Yahya'b' Khan was replaced by Zulfikar Ali Bhutto as president; the 'b'country worked towards promulgating its constitution and put'b'ting the country on the road to democracy. Democratic rule r'b'esumed from 1972 to 1977 \xe2\x80\x94 an era of self-consciousness, int'b'ellectual leftism, nationalism, and nationwide reconstructio'b'n.[143] In 1972 Pakistan embarked on an ambitious plan to de'b'velop its nuclear deterrence capability with the goal of pre'b"venting any foreign invasion; the country's first nuclear po"b'wer plant was inaugurated in that same year.[144][145] Accel'b"erated in response to India's first nuclear test in 1974, th"b'is crash program was completed in 1979.[145]\n\nDemocracy ende'b'd with a military coup in 1977 against the leftist PPP, whic'b'h saw General Zia-ul-Haq become the president in 1978. From 'b"1977 to 1988, President Zia's corporatisation and economic I"b'slamisation initiatives led to Pakistan becoming one of the 'b'fastest-growing economies in South Asia.[146] While building'b" up the country's nuclear program, increasing Islamisation,["b'147] and the rise of a homegrown conservative philosophy, Pa'b'kistan helped subsidise and distribute US resources to facti'b"ons of the mujahideen against the USSR's intervention in com"b"munist Afghanistan.[148][149] Pakistan's North-West Frontier"b' Province became a base for the anti-Soviet Afghan fighters,'b" with the province's influential Deobandi ulama playing a si"b"gnificant role in encouraging and organising the 'jihad'.[15"b'0]\n\nPresident Zia died in a plane crash in 1988, and Benazir'b' Bhutto, daughter of Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, was elected as the'b" country's first female Prime Minister.

It is the 33rd-largest n'b'ation by total area, although this ranking varies depending 'b'on how the disputed territory of Kashmir is counted. Pakista'b'n has a 1,046 km (650 mi) coastline along the Arabian Sea an'b'd the Gulf of Oman in the south[167] and land borders of 6,7'b'74 km (4,209 mi) in total: 2,430 km (1,510 mi) with Afghanis'b'tan, 523 km (325 mi) with China, 2,912 km (1,809 mi) with In'b'dia and 909 km (565 mi) with Iran.[168] It shares a marine b'b'order with Oman,[169] and is separated from Tajikistan by th'b'e cold, narrow Wakhan Corridor.[170] Pakistan occupies a geo'b'politically important location at the crossroads of South As'b'ia, the Middle East, and Central Asia.[12]\n\nGeologically, Pa'b'kistan is located in the Indus\xe2\x80\x93Tsangpo Suture Zone and overl'b'aps the Indian tectonic plate in its Sindh and Punjab provin'b'ces; Balochistan and most of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa are within t'b'he Eurasian plate, mainly on the Iranian plateau. Gilgit\xe2\x80\x93Bal'b'tistan and Azad Kashmir lie along the edge of the Indian pla'b'te and hence are prone to violent earthquakes. This region h'b'as the highest rates of seismicity and largest earthquakes i'b'n the Himalaya region.[171] Ranging from the coastal areas o'b'f the south to the glaciated mountains of the north, Pakista'b"n's landscapes vary from plains to deserts, forests, hills, "b'and plateaus.[172]\n\n\nK2, the second-highest mountain on Eart'b"h\n\nKatpana Desert, the world's highest cold desert\n\nNanga Pa"b'rbat, the ninth-highest mountain on Earth\nPakistan is divide'b'd into three major geographic areas: the northern highlands,'b' the Indus River plain, and the Balochistan Plateau.[173] Th'b'e northern highlands contain the Karakoram, Hindu Kush, and 'b'Pamir mountain ranges (see mountains of Pakistan), which con'b"tain some of the world's highest peaks, including five of th"b'e fourteen eight-thousanders (mountain peaks over 8,000 metr'b'es or 26,250 feet), which attract adventurers and mountainee'b'rs from all over the world, notably K2 (8,611 m or 28,251 ft'b') and Nanga Parbat (8,126 m or 26,660 ft).[174] The Balochis'b'tan Plateau lies in the west and the Thar Desert in the east'b'. The 1,609 km (1,000 mi) Indus River and its tributaries fl'b'ow through the country from the Kashmir region to the Arabia'b'n Sea. There is an expanse of alluvial plains along it in th'b'e Punjab and Sindh.[175]\n\nThe climate varies from tropical t'b'o temperate, with arid conditions in the coastal south. Ther'b'e is a monsoon season with frequent flooding due to heavy ra'b'infall, and a dry season with significantly less rainfall or'b' none at all. There are four distinct seasons: a cool, dry w'b'inter from December through February; a hot, dry spring from'b' March through May; the summer rainy season, or southwest mo'b'nsoon period, from June through September; and the retreatin'b'g monsoon period of October and November.[86] Rainfall varie'b's greatly from year to year, and patterns of alternate flood'b'ing and drought are common.[176]\n\nFlora and fauna\nMain artic'b'les: Flora of Pakistan and Fauna of Pakistan\nThe diversity o'b'f the landscape and climate in Pakistan allows a wide variet'b'y of trees and plants to flourish. The forests range from co'b'niferous alpine and subalpine trees such as spruce, pine, an'b'd deodar cedar in the extreme northern mountains to deciduou'b's trees in most of the country (for example, the mulberry-li'b'ke shisham found in the Sulaiman Mountains), to palms such a'b's coconut and date in the southern Punjab, southern Balochis'b'tan, and all of Sindh. The western hills are home to juniper'b', tamarisk, coarse grasses, and scrub plants. Mangrove fores'b'ts form much of the coastal wetlands along the coast in the 'b'south.[177]\n\nConiferous forests are found at altitudes rangi'b'ng from 1,000 to 4,000 metres (3,300 to 13,100 feet) in most'b' of the northern and northwestern highlands. In the xeric re'b'gions of Balochistan, date palm and Ephedra are common. In m'b'ost of the Punjab and Sindh, the Indus plains support tropic'b'al and subtropical dry and moist broadleaf forest as well as'b' tropical and xeric shrublands. These forests are mostly of 'b'mulberry, acacia, and eucalyptus.[178] About 2.2% or 1,687,0'b'00 hectares (16,870 km2) of Pakistan was forested in 2010.[1'b'79]\n\nMedv\xc4\x9bd plav\xc3\xbd (Ursus arctos isabellinus).jpg\nTibetan Wol'b'f.JPG\nLightmatter snowleopard.jpg\nBear, Tibetan wolf, and sn'b'ow leopard, respectively\nThe fauna of Pakistan also reflects'b" the country's varied climate. Around 668 bird species are f"b'ound there,[180][181] including crows, sparrows, mynas, hawk'b's, falcons, and eagles. Palas, Kohistan, has a significant p'b'opulation of western tragopan.[182] Many birds sighted in Pa'b'kistan are migratory, coming from Europe, Central Asia, and 'b'India.[183]\n\nThe southern plains are home to mongooses, cive'b'ts, hares, the Asiatic jackal, the Indian pangolin, the jung'b'le cat, and the desert cat. There are mugger crocodiles in t'b'he Indus, and wild boar, deer, porcupines, and small rodents'b' in the surrounding areas. The sandy scrublands of central P'b'akistan are home to Asiatic jackals, striped hyenas, wildcat'b's, and leopards.[184][185] The lack of vegetative cover, the'b' severe climate, and the impact of grazing on the deserts ha'b've left wild animals in a precarious position. The chinkara 'b'is the only animal that can still be found in significant nu'b'mbers in Cholistan. A small number of nilgai are found along'b' the Pakistan\xe2\x80\x93India border and in some parts of Cholistan.[1'b'84][186] A wide variety of animals live in the mountainous n'b'orth, including the Marco Polo sheep, the urial (a subspecie'b's of wild sheep), the markhor goat, the ibex goat, the Asian'b' black bear, and the Himalayan brown bear.[184][187][188] Am'b'ong the rare animals found in the area are the snow leopard['b'187] and the blind Indus river dolphin, of which there are b'b'elieved to be about 1,100 remaining, protected at the Indus 'b'River Dolphin Reserve in Sindh.[187][189] In total, 174 mamm'b'als, 177 reptiles, 22 amphibians, 198 freshwater fish specie'b's and 5,000 species of invertebrates (including insects) hav'b'e been recorded in Pakistan.[180][181]\n\nThe flora and fauna 'b'of Pakistan suffer from a number of problems. Pakistan has t'b'he second-highest rate of deforestation in the world, which,'b' along with hunting and pollution, has had adverse effects o'b'n the ecosystem. The government has established a large numb'b'er of protected areas, wildlife sanctuaries, and game reserv'b'es to address these issues.[180][181]\n\nNational parks and wi'b'ldlife sanctuaries\nMain articles: Protected areas of Pakista'b'n and National parks of Pakistan\n\nDeosai National Park cover'b"s the world's second-highest plateau.\nAt present, there are "b'around 157 protected areas in Pakistan that are recognised b'b"y the IUCN. According to the 'Modern Protected Areas' legisl"b'ation, a national park is a protected area set aside by the 'b'government for the protection and conservation of its outsta'b'nding scenery and wildlife in a natural state. The oldest na'b'tional park is Lal Suhanra in Bahawalpur District, establish'b'ed in 1972.[190] It is one of the only two biosphere reserve'b's of Pakistan; the other is the Ziarat Juniper Forest, which'b' is the largest contiguous natural juniper forest in Pakista'b'n. It is also the second oldest, after the one in California'b'.[191] Central Karakoram in Gilgit Baltistan is currently th'b'e largest national park in the country, encompassing a total'b' approximate area of 1,390,100 hectares (3,435,011.9 acres).'b' The smallest national park is the Ayub, covering a total ap'b'proximate area of 931 hectares (2,300.6 acres).\n\nGovernment 'b'and politics\nMain articles: Government of Pakistan, Politics'b' of Pakistan, Political history of Pakistan, and Human right'b"s in Pakistan\n\nParliament House\nPakistan's political experie"b'nce is essentially related to the struggle of Indian Muslims'b' to regain the power they lost to British colonisation.[192]'b' Pakistan is a democratic parliamentary federal republic, wi'b'th Islam as the state religion.[14] The first constitution w'b'as adopted in 1956 but suspended by Ayub Khan in 1958, who r'b'eplaced it with the second constitution in 1962.[97] A compl'b'ete and comprehensive constitution was adopted in 1973 \xe2\x80\x94 it 'b'was suspended by Zia-ul-Haq in 1977 but reinstated in 1985 \xe2\x80\x94'b" is the country's most important document, laying the founda"b'tions of the current government.[168] The Pakistani military'b' establishment has played an influential role in mainstream 'b"politics throughout Pakistan's political history.[97] The pe"b'riods 1958\xe2\x80\x931971, 1977\xe2\x80\x931988, and 1999\xe2\x80\x932008 saw military coups'b' that resulted in the imposition of martial law and military'b' commanders who governed as de facto presidents.[193] Today 'b'Pakistan has a multi-party parliamentary system with clear d'b'ivision of powers and checks and balances among the branches'b' of government. The first successful democratic transition o'b'ccurred in May 2013. Politics in Pakistan is centred on, and'b' dominated by, a homegrown social philosophy comprising a bl'b'end of ideas from socialism, conservatism, and the third way'b'. As of the general elections held in 2013, the three main p'b'olitical parties in the country are: the centre-right conser'b'vative Pakistan Muslim League-N; the centre-left socialist P'b'PP; and the centrist and third-way Pakistan Movement for Jus'b'tice (PTI).\n\nHead of State: The President, who is elected by'b' an Electoral College is the ceremonial head of the state an'b'd is the civilian commander-in-chief of the Pakistan Armed F'b'orces (with the Chairman Joint Chiefs of Staff Committee as 'b'principal military adviser), but military appointments and k'b'ey confirmations in the armed forces are made by the Prime M'b"inister after reviewing the reports on candidates' merit and"b' performance. Almost all appointed officers in the judicatur'b'e, military, chairman joint chiefs, and joint staff, and leg'b'islature require the executive confirmation from the Prime M'b'inister, whom the President must consult, by law. However, t'b'he powers to pardon and grant clemency lie with the Presiden'b't of Pakistan.\nLegislative: The bicameral legislature compri'b'ses a 100-member Senate (upper house) and a 342-member Natio'b'nal Assembly (lower house). Members of the National Assembly'b' are elected through the first-past-the-post system under un'b'iversal adult suffrage, representing electoral districts kno'b'wn as National Assembly constituencies. According to the con'b'stitution, the 70 seats reserved for women and religious min'b'orities are allocated to the political parties according to 'b'their proportional representation. Senate members are electe'b'd by provincial legislators, with all the provinces having e'b"qual representation.\n\nPrime Minister's Secretariat\nExecutive"b': The Prime Minister is usually the leader of the majority r'b'ule party or a coalition in the National Assembly\xe2\x80\x94 the lower'b' house. The Prime Minister serves as the head of government 'b"and is designated to exercise as the country's chief executi"b've. The Prime Minister is responsible for appointing a cabin'b'et consisting of ministers and advisers as well as running t'b'he government operations, taking and authorising executive d'b'ecisions, appointments and recommendations that require exec'b'utive confirmation of the Prime Minister.\nProvincial governm'b'ents: Each of the four province has a similar system of gove'b'rnment, with a directly elected Provincial Assembly in which'b' the leader of the largest party or coalition is elected Chi'b'ef Minister. Chief Ministers oversees the provincial governm'b'ents and head the provincial cabinet, it is common in Pakist'b'an to have different ruling parties or coalitions in each pr'b'ovinces. The provincial assemblies have power to make laws a'b'nd approve provincial budget which is commonly presented by 'b'the provincial finance minister every fiscal year. Provincia'b'l governors who play role as the ceremonial head of province'b' are appointed by the President.[168]\n\nSupreme Court of Paki'b'stan\nJudicature: The judiciary of Pakistan is a hierarchical'b' system with two classes of courts: the superior (or higher)'b' judiciary and the subordinate (or lower) judiciary. The Chi'b'ef Justice of Pakistan is the chief judge who oversees the j'b"udicature's court system at all levels of command. The super"b'ior judiciary is composed of the Supreme Court of Pakistan, 'b'the Federal Shariat Court and five High Courts, with the Sup'b'reme Court at the apex. The Constitution of Pakistan entrust'b's the superior judiciary with the obligation to preserve, pr'b'otect and defend the constitution. Neither the Supreme Court'b' nor a High Court may exercise jurisdiction in relation to T'b'ribal Areas, except otherwise provided for. The disputed reg'b'ions of Azad Kashmir and Gilgit\xe2\x80\x93Baltistan have separate cour'b't systems.\nForeign relations\nMain article: Foreign relations'b' of Pakistan\n(L-R) English: Motorcade for President Mohammad'b' Ayub Khan of Pakistan.

Kenn'b"edy in 1961.\nAs the Muslim world's second most populous nati"b'on-state (after Indonesia) and its only nuclear power state,'b' Pakistan has an important role in the international communi'b'ty.[194][195] With a semi-agricultural and semi-industrializ'b'ed economy, its foreign policy determines its standard of in'b'teractions for its organisations, corporations, and individu'b'al citizens.[196][197] Its geostrategic intentions were expl'b'ained by Jinnah in a broadcast message in 1947, which is fea'b"tured in a prominent quotation on the homepage of Pakistan's"b' Ministry of Foreign Affairs website: "The foundation of our'b' foreign policy is friendship with all nations across the gl'b'obe."[198]\n\nAfter Independence, Pakistan vigorously pursued 'b'bilateral relations with other Muslim countries[199] and mad'b'e an active bid for leadership of the Muslim world, or at le'b'ast for leadership in efforts to achieve unity.[200] The Ali'b' brothers had sought to project Pakistan as the natural lead'b'er of the Islamic world, in part due to its large manpower a'b'nd military strength.[201] A top-ranking Muslim League leade'b'r, Khaliquzzaman, declared that Pakistan would bring togethe'b'r all Muslim countries into Islamistan \xe2\x80\x94 a pan-Islamic entit'b"y.[202]\n\nSuch developments (along with Pakistan's creation) "b'did not get American approval, and British Prime Minister Cl'b'ement Attlee voiced international opinion at the time by sta'b'ting that he wished that India and Pakistan would re-unite.['b'203] Since most of the Arab world was undergoing a nationali'b'st awakening at the time, there was little attraction to Pak'b"istan's Pan-Islamic aspirations.[204] Some of the Arab count"b"ries saw the 'Islamistan' project as a Pakistani attempt to "b'dominate other Muslim states.[205]\n\nPakistan vigorously cham'b'pioned the right of self-determination for Muslims around th'b"e world. Pakistan's efforts for the independence movements o"b'f Indonesia, Algeria, Tunisia, Morocco, and Eritrea were sig'b'nificant and initially led to close ties between these count'b'ries and Pakistan.[206] However, Pakistan also masterminded 'b'an attack on the Afghan city of Jalalabad during the Afghan 'b'Civil War to establish an Islamic government there. Pakistan'b" had wished to foment an 'Islamic Revolution' that would tra"b'nscend national borders, covering Pakistan, Afghanistan, and'b" Central Asia.[207]\n\nOn the other hand, Pakistan's relations"b' with Iran have been strained at times due to sectarian tens'b'ions.[208] Iran and Saudi Arabia used Pakistan as a battlegr'b'ound for their proxy sectarian war, and by the 1990s Pakista'b"n's support for the Sunni Taliban organisation in Afghanista"b'n became a problem for Shia Iran, which opposed a Taliban-co'b'ntrolled Afghanistan.[209] Tensions between Iran and Pakista'b'n intensified in 1998 when Iran accused Pakistan of war crim'b"es after Pakistani warplanes had bombarded Afghanistan's las"b't Shia stronghold in support of the Taliban.[210][211]\n\n\nPak'b"istan's incumbent Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif with his India"b'n counterpart Narendra Modi\nSince Independence, Pakistan has'b' attempted to balance its relations with foreign nations.[21'b'2][213][214] Pakistan is an influential and founding member 'b'of the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) and is a ma'b'jor non-NATO ally of the United States in the war against te'b"rrorism \xe2\x80\x94 a status achieved in 2004.[215] Pakistan's foreign"b' policy and geostrategy mainly focus on the economy and secu'b'rity against threats to its national identity and territoria'b'l integrity, and on the cultivation of close relations with 'b'other Muslim countries.[216] Maintaining cultural, political'b', social, and economic relations with the Arab world and oth'b'er countries in the Muslim world is a vital factor in Pakist'b"an's foreign policy.[217]\n\nThe Kashmir conflict remains the "b'major point of contention between Pakistan and India; three 'b'of their four wars were fought over this territory.[218] Due'b' partly to difficulties in relations with its geopolitical r'b'ival India, Pakistan maintains close political relations wit'b'h Turkey and Iran,[219] and both countries have been a focal'b" point in Pakistan's foreign policy.[219] Saudi Arabia also "b"maintains a respected position in Pakistan's foreign policy."b'\n\nA non-signatory party of the Treaty on Nuclear Non-Prolife'b'ration, Pakistan is an influential member of the IAEA.[220] 'b'In recent events, Pakistan has blocked an international trea'b'ty to limit fissile material, arguing that the "treaty would'b' target Pakistan specifically".[221] In the 20th century, Pa'b"kistan's nuclear deterrence program focused on countering In"b"dia's nuclear ambitions in the region, and nuclear tests by "b'India eventually led Pakistan to reciprocate to maintain a g'b'eopolitical balance as becoming a nuclear power.[222] Curren'b'tly, Pakistan maintains a policy of credible minimum deterre'b'nce, calling its program vital nuclear deterrence against fo'b'reign aggression.[223][224]\n\nLocated in the strategic and ge'b"opolitical corridor of the world's major maritime oil supply"b' lines and communication fibre optics, Pakistan has proximit'b'y to the natural resources of Central Asian countries.[225] 'b"Briefing on the country's foreign policy in 2004, a Pakistan"b'i senator[clarification needed] reportedly explained: "Pakis'b'tan highlights sovereign equality of states, bilateralism, m'b"utuality of interests, and non-interference in each other's "b'domestic affairs as the cardinal features of its foreign pol'b'icy."[226] Pakistan is an active member of the United Nation'b"s and has a Permanent Representative to represent Pakistan's"b' positions in international politics.[227] Pakistan has lobb'b'ied for the concept of "enlightened moderation" in the Musli'b'm world.[228][229] Pakistan is also a member of Commonwealth'b' of Nations,[230] the South Asian Association for Regional C'b'ooperation (SAARC), the Economic Cooperation Organisation (E'b'CO),[231][232] and the G20 developing nations.[233]\n\nPakista'b'n does not have diplomatic relations with Israel;[234] nonet'b'heless, some Israeli citizens have visited the country on to'b'urist visas.[235] However, an exchange took place between th'b'e two countries using Turkey as a communication conduit.[236'b'] Despite Pakistan being the only country in the world that 'b'has not established diplomatic relations with Armenia, an Ar'b'menian community still resides in Pakistan.[237] Pakistan ha'b'd warm relations with Bangladesh despite initial strains in 'b'their relationship,[238] but the relationship has soured rec'b'ently.\n\n\nPakistan Prime Minister Huseyn Shaheed Suhrawardy w'b'ith Chinese Premier Zhou Enlai signing the Treaty of Friends'b"hip Between China and Pakistan. Pakistan is host to China's "b'largest embassy.[239]\nBecause of ideological differences, Pa'b'kistan opposed the Soviet Union in the 1950s, and during the'b' Soviet-Afghan War in the 1980s, Pakistan was one of the clo'b'sest allies of the United States.[226][240] Relations betwee'b'n Pakistan and Russia have greatly improved since 1999, and 'b'co-operation in various sectors has increased.[241] Pakistan'b' has had an "on-and-off" relationship with the United States'b'. A close ally of the United States during the Cold war, Pak'b"istan's relationship with the United States soured in the 19"b"90s when the US imposed sanctions because of Pakistan's secr"b'etive nuclear development.[242] Since 9/11, Pakistan has bee'b'n a close ally of the United States on the issue of counter-'b'terrorism in the regions of the Middle East and South Asia, 'b'with the US supporting Pakistan with aid money and weapons.['b'243][244] Initially, the United States-led war on terrorism 'b'led to an improvement in the relationship, but it was strain'b'ed by a divergence of interests and resulting mistrust durin'b'g the war in Afghanistan and by issues related to terrorism.'b'[245][246][247][248]\n\nPakistan was the first country to have'b' established diplomatic relations with China, and the relati'b"onship continues to be warm since China's war with India in "b'1962.[249] In the 1960s to 1980s, Pakistan greatly helped Ch'b"ina in reaching out to the world's major countries and helpe"b"d facilitate US President Nixon's state visit to China.[249]"b' Despite the change of governments in Pakistan and fluctuati'b'ons in the regional and global situation, China policy in Pa'b'kistan continues to be a dominant factor at all times.[249] 'b"In return, China is Pakistan's largest trading partner, and "b'economic co-operation has flourished, with substantial Chine'b"se investment in Pakistan's infrastructural expansion such a"b's the Pakistani deep-water port at Gwadar. Sino-Pakistani fr'b'iendly relations touched new heights as both the countries s'b'igned 51 agreements and Memorandums of Understanding (MoUs) 'b'in 2015 for co-operation in different areas.[250][251][252]['b'253] Both countries signed a Free Trade Agreement in the 200'b"0s, and Pakistan continues to serve as China's communication"b' bridge to the Muslim world.[254] In 2016 China announced th'b'at it will set up an anti-terrorism alliance with Pakistan, 'b'Afghanistan, and Tajikistan.[255]\n\nAdministrative divisions\n'b'Main articles: Administrative units of Pakistan and District'b's of Pakistan\nAdministrative Division\tCapital\tPopulation\n Ba'b'lochistan\tQuetta\t7,914,000\n Punjab\tLahore\t101,000,000\n Sindh'b'\tKarachi\t42,400,000\n Khyber Pakhtunkhwa\tPeshawar\t28,000,000\n'b' Gilgit-Baltistan\tGilgit\t1,800,000\n FATA\t\t3,176,331\n Azad Ka'b'shmir\tMuzaffarabad\t4,567,982\nProposed Flag of Islamabad Capi'b'tal Territory.svg Islamabad Capital Territory\tIslamabad\t1,15'b'1,868\nA federal parliamentary republic state, Pakistan is a 'b'federation that comprises four provinces: Punjab, Khyber Pak'b'htunkhwa, Sindh, and Balochistan[256] and four territories: 'b'the Federally Administered Tribal Areas, Islamabad Capital T'b'erritory Gilgit\xe2\x80\x93Baltistan, and Azad Kashmir.

In'b' 2009, the constitutional assignment (the Gilgit\xe2\x80\x93Baltistan E'b'mpowerment and Self-Governance Order) awarded the Gilgit\xe2\x80\x93Bal'b'tistan a semi-provincial status, giving it self-government.['b'257] The population of Gilgit-Baltistan wants to be merged i'b'nto Pakistan as a separate fifth province and opposes integr'b'ation with Kashmir[258][259] while the people of Azad Kashmi'b'r have also always wanted to be a part of Pakistan, despite 'b"Pakistan's having imposed its will on their region.[260] The"b' populations of Azad Kashmir and Gilgit-Baltistan also wante'b'd to join Pakistan during Independence.[261][262]\n\nSince 194'b'8 there has been an ongoing, and at times fluctuating, viole'b'nt conflict in the south-western province of Balochistan bet'b'ween various Baloch separatist groups, who seek greater poli'b'tical autonomy, and the central government of Pakistan. Most'b' Balochs want autonomy but do not want independence from Pak'b'istan.[263]\n\nThe local government system consists of a three'b'-tier system of districts, tehsils, and union councils, with'b' an elected body at each tier.[264] There are about 130 dist'b'ricts altogether, of which Azad Kashmir has ten[265] and Gil'b'git\xe2\x80\x93Baltistan seven.[266] The Tribal Areas comprise seven tr'b'ibal agencies and six small frontier regions detached from n'b'eighbouring districts.[267]\n\nClickable map of the four provi'b'nces and four federal territories of Pakistan.\n A clickable 'b'map of Pakistan exhibiting its administrative units.\nAbout t'b'his image\n\nLaw enforcement is carried out by a joint network'b' of the intelligence community with jurisdiction limited to 'b'the relevant province or territory.

The Penal code has limited juris'b'diction in the Tribal Areas, where law is largely derived fr'b'om tribal customs.[268][273]\n\nKashmir conflict\nMain article:'b' Kashmir conflict\nThe Kashmir \xe2\x80\x94 the most northwesterly regio'b'n of South Asia \xe2\x80\x94 is a major territorial dispute that has hi'b'ndered relations between India and Pakistan. The two nations'b' have fought at least three large-scale conventional wars in'b' successive years in 1947, 1965, and 1971. The conflict in 1'b"971 witnessed Pakistan's unconditional surrender and a treat"b'y that subsequently led to the independence of Bangladesh.[2'b'74] Other serious military engagements and skirmishes have i'b'ncluded the armed contacts in Siachen Glacier (1984) and Kar'b'gil (1999).[218] Approximately 45.1% of the Kashmir region i'b's controlled by India, which also claims the entire state of'b' Jammu and Kashmir, including most of Jammu, the Kashmir Val'b'ley, Ladakh, and the Siachen.[218] The claim is contested by'b' Pakistan, which controls approximately 38.2% of the Kashmir'b' region, an area known as the Azad Kashmir and Gilgit\xe2\x80\x93Baltis'b'tan.[218][275]\n\n\nAzad Kashmir is part of Pakistan-controlled'b' Kashmir.\nIndia claims the Kashmir on the basis of the Instr'b"ument of Accession \xe2\x80\x94 a legal agreement with Kashmir's leader"b's executed by Maharaja Hari Singh, who agreed to accede the 'b'area to India.[276] Pakistan claims Kashmir on the basis of 'b'a Muslim majority and of geography, the same principles that'b' were applied for the creation of the two independent states'b'.[277][278] India referred the dispute to the United Nations'b' on 1 January 1948.[279] In a resolution passed in 1948, the'b" UN's General Assembly asked Pakistan to remove most of its "b'troops as a plebiscite would then be held. However, Pakistan'b' failed to vacate the region and a ceasefire was reached in 'b'1949 establishing a Line of Control (LoC) that divided Kashm'b'ir between the two nations.[280] India, fearful that the Mus'b'lim majority populace of Kashmir would secede from India, di'b'd not allow a plebiscite to take place in the region. This w'b"as confirmed in a statement by India's Defense Minister, Kri"b'shna Menon, who said: "Kashmir would vote to join Pakistan a'b'nd no Indian Government responsible for agreeing to plebisci'b'te would survive."[281]\n\nPakistan claims that its position i'b's for the right of the people of Jammu and Kashmir to determ'b'ine their future through impartial elections as mandated by 'b'the United Nations,[282] while India has stated that Kashmir'b' is an integral part of India, referring to the Simla Agreem'b'ent (1972) and to the fact that elections take place regular'b'ly.[283] In recent developments, certain Kashmiri independen'b'ce groups believe that Kashmir should be independent of both'b' India and Pakistan.[218]\n\nLaw enforcement\nMain articles: La'b'w enforcement in Pakistan, Pakistan Intelligence Community, 'b'and National Intelligence Directorate (Pakistan)\nThe law enf'b'orcement in Pakistan is carried out by joint network of seve'b'ral federal and provincial police agencies. The four provinc'b'es and the Islamabad Capital Territory (ICT) each have a civ'b'ilian police force with jurisdiction extending only to the r'b'elevant province or territory.[168] At the federal level, th'b'ere are a number of civilian intelligence agencies with nati'b'onwide jurisdictions including the Federal Investigation Age'b'ncy (FIA), Intelligence Bureau (IB), and the Motorway Patrol'b', as well as several paramilitary forces such as the Nationa'b'l Guards (Northern Areas), the Rangers (Punjab and Sindh), a'b'nd the Frontier Corps (Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan).\n'b'\nThe most senior officers of all the civilian police forces 'b'also form part of the Police Service, which is a component o'b'f the civil service of Pakistan. Namely, there are four prov'b'incial police service including the Punjab Police, Sindh Pol'b'ice, Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa Police, and the Balochistan Police; 'b'all headed by the appointed senior Inspector-Generals. The I'b'CT has its own police component, the Capital Police, to main'b'tain law and order in the capital. The CID bureaus are the c'b'rime investigation unit and forms a vital part in each provi'b'ncial police service.\n\nThe law enforcement in Pakistan also 'b'has a Motorway Patrol which is responsible for enforcement o'b'f traffic and safety laws, security and recovery on Pakistan'b"'s inter-provincial motorway network. In each of provincial "b'Police Service, it also maintains a respective Elite Police 'b'units led by the NACTA \xe2\x80\x94 a counter-terrorism police unit as 'b'well as providing VIP escorts. In the Punjab and Sindh, the 'b'Pakistan Rangers are an internal security force with the pri'b'me objective to provide and maintain security in war zones a'b'nd areas of conflict as well as maintaining law and order wh'b'ich includes providing assistance to the police.[284] The Fr'b'ontier Corps serves the similar purpose in Khyber-Pakhtunkhw'b'a, and the Balochistan.[284]\n\nRole of Islam in Pakistan\nMain'b" articles: Objectives Resolution and Muhammad Zia-ul-Haq's I"b'slamization\nPakistan was created in the name of Islam.[30][3'b'1] The idea of Pakistan had received overwhelming popular su'b'pport among Indian Muslims, especially those in the province'b's of British India where Muslims were in a minority such as 'b'U.P.[285] The Muslim League leadership, ulama (Islamic clerg'b'y) and Jinnah had articulated their vision of Pakistan in te'b'rms of an Islamic state.[286] Jinnah had developed a close a'b'ssociation with the ulama.[287] When Jinnah died, Islamic sc'b'holar Maulana Shabbir Ahmad Usmani described Jinnah as the g'b'reatest Muslim after the Mughal Emperor Aurangzeb and also c'b"ompared Jinnah's death to the Prophet's passing.[287] Usmani"b" asked Pakistanis to remember Jinnah's message of Unity, Fai"b'th and Discipline and work to fulfil his dream:[288]\n\nto cre'b'ate a solid bloc of all Muslim states from Karachi to Ankara'b', from Pakistan to Morocco. He [Jinnah] wanted to see the Mu'b'slims of the world united under the banner of Islam as an ef'b'fective check against the aggressive designs of their enemie'b's.\n\nThe first formal step taken to transform Pakistan into a'b'n ideological Islamic state was in March 1949 when the count'b"ry's first Prime Minister, Liaquat Ali Khan, introduced the "b'Objectives Resolution in the Constituent Assembly.[289] The 'b'Objectives Resolution declared that sovereignty over the ent'b'ire universe belongs to God Almighty.[131] The president of 'b'the Muslim League, Chaudhry Khaliquzzaman, announced that Pa'b'kistan would bring together all Muslim countries into Islami'b'stan-a pan-Islamic entity.[290] Khaliq believed that Pakista'b'n was only a Muslim state and was not yet an Islamic state, 'b'but that it could certainly become an Islamic state after br'b'inging all believers of Islam into a single political unit.['b'291] Keith Callard, one of the earliest scholars on Pakistan'b'i politics, observed that Pakistanis believed in the essenti'b'al unity of purpose and outlook in the Muslim world:[292]\n\nP'b'akistan was founded to advance the cause of Muslims. Other M'b'uslims might have been expected to be sympathetic, even enth'b'usiastic. But this assumed that other Muslim states would ta'b'ke the same view of the relation bet\n'
